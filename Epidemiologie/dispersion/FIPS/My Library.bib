	abstract = {A method for predicting canopy wetness and humidity from   remotely-acquired meteorological and radiation data is described. This   method employs a surface energy balance model to scale from the   above-canopy macroclimate to in-canopy microclimate conditions.   Above-canopy temperature, vapor pressure, and wind speed inputs were   obtained from objective analyses of hourly measurements from the   synoptic weather network, while downwelling long- and short-wave   radiation forcings were estimated from standard satellite observations.   Precipitation (irrigation + rainfall) was the only input acquired   in-field. Model predictions compared well with measurements of nighttime   dew accumulation and relative humidity made in irrigated potato crops   grown in central Wisconsin. Maximum dew amount measured in full canopies   over four nights was reproduced to within 0.05 to 0.1 mm. The practical   utility of this method to disease management was assessed by processing   modeled and measured canopy microclimate data from two weather stations   over three growing seasons through the BLITECAST disease forecasting   system. Given the uncertainties inherent in the measurement of humidity,   the model reasonably reproduced disease severity values generated from   in-situ measurements in all but one case, where the canopy had suffered   partial defoliation. Because the model simulates the microclimate within   a healthy, uniform canopy, it may in many cases produce more reliable   regional forecasts for plant disease than would a single set of in-situ   measurements.},

	abstract = {The ecosystem services concept provides a means to define successful   disease management more broadly, beyond short-term crop yield   evaluations. Plant disease can affect ecosystem services directly, such   as through removal of plants providing services, or indirectly through   the effects of disease management activities, including pesticide   applications, tillage, and other methods of plant removal. Increased   plant biodiversity may reduce disease risk if susceptible host tissue   becomes less common, or may increase risk if additional plant species   are important in completing pathogen life cycles. Arthropod and   microbial biodiversity may play similar roles. Distant ecosystems may   provide a disservice as the setting for the evolution of pathogens that   later invade a focal ecosystem, where plants have not evolved defenses.   Conversely, distant ecosystems may provide a service as sources of   genetic resources of great value to agriculture, including disease   resistance genes. Good policies are needed to support conservation and   optimal use of genetic resources, protect ecosystems from exotic   pathogens, and limit the homogeneity of agricultural systems. Research   is needed to provide policy makers, farmers, and consumers with the   information required for evaluating trade-offs in the pursuit of the   full range of ecosystem services desired from managed and native   ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Although the frequency and effects of neutral and nearly neutral mutations are critical to evolutionary patterns and processes governed by genetic drift, the small effects of such mutations make them difficult to study empirically. Here we present the results of a mutation-accumulation experiment designed to assess the frequencies of deleterious mutations with undetectable effects. We promoted the accumulation of spontaneous mutations by subjecting independent lineages of the RNA virus 6 to repeated population bottlenecks of a single individual. We measured fitness following every bottleneck to obtain a complete picture of the timing and effects of the accumulated mutations with detectable effects and sequenced complete genomes to determine the number of mutations that were undetected by the fitness assays. To estimate the effects of the undetected mutations, we implemented a likelihood model developed for quantitative trait locus (QTL) data (Otto and Jones 2000) to estimate the number and effects of the undetected mutations from the measured number and effects of the detected mutations. Using this method we estimated a deleterious mutation rate of U = 0.03 and a gamma effects distribution with mean s=0.093 and coefficient of variation = 0.204. Although our estimates of U and s fall within the range of recent mutation rate and effect estimates in eukaryotes, the fraction of mutations with detectable effects on laboratory fitness (39\%) appears to be far higher in 6 than in eukaryotes.},

C   gloeosporioides from lesions on wild grape and oak were sampled at two   sites adjacent to commercial strawberry fields in Florida and two   distant sites. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker data and   restriction enzyme digests of amplified rDNA were used to determine   whether isolates were from the same C gloeosporioides subgroup that   infects strawberry. There were 17 to 24 native host isolates from each   site that clustered with a group of strawberry crown isolates based on   RAPD markers. Among strawberry isolates, there were two rDNA genotypes   identified by restriction enzyme analysis. Both genotypes were present   among native host isolates sampled from all four sites. There was some   evidence that the different rDNA genotypes differentiated two closely   related subpopulations, although the proportion of pathogenic isolates   from native hosts among the two different genotypes was not different.   The incidence of isolates pathogenic to strawberry was greater at sites   close to strawberry fields relative to sites distant from strawberry   fields for isolates with a BstUI(-)/MspI(+) rDNA genotype (44 versus   13\%), a BstUI(+)/MspI(-) genotype (57 versus 16\%), or when both   genotypes were analyzed together (46 versus 15\%). Based on these   results, it appears that the C gloeosporioides subgoup that causes crown   rot on strawberry is widely distributed in Florida and that selection   for pathogenicity on strawberry occurs in the area where this host is   grown in abundance.},

Higher genetic   variation (H = 0.312 and 0.335) in the northern Population of C.   gloeosporioides than ill the Southern population (H = 0.261 and 0.186),   according to the RAPD and MP-PCR markets, respectively, was indicative   of a difference between the northern and southern Populations.

However, there was no differentiation between   locations within the northern or Southern populations, indicating   significant gene flow.

Pathogenicity   tests confirmed that the SGO isolates infected sweet orange flowers   only, the KLA isolates infected both sweet orange flowers and Key lime   foliage, and the FGG isolates did not infect either of these host   tissues. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the C. acutatum-specific   primer CaInt2 and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)4 primer (from a   conserved sequence of ribosomal DNA [rDNA]) amplified a 490-bp fragment   from the SGO and KLA isolates but not from the FGG isolates. PCR with   the C, gloeosporioides-specific primer CgInt and the ITS4 primer   amplified a 450-bp fragment only from the FGG isolates. The nucleotide   sequence of the rDNA ITS1 of four SGO and four KLA isolates indicated   either complete homology or a I-base difference from a C. acutatum   reference isolate but only 80 to 81\% homology to a C. gloeosporioides   reference isolate. The ITS1 sequence of the FGG isolates had 97\%   homology to the C. gloeosporioides reference isolate but only 80\%   homology to the C. acutatum reference isolate. These data confirmed the   classification of the SGO and KLA isolates as C. acutatum and the FGG   isolates as C. gloeosporioides. Cluster analysis of rDNA and   mitochondrial DNA restriction fragments divided the SGO and KLA isolates   into two recognizable groups with genetic similarity of 87\%.

We present a pathogen-generic method to estimate the   spatial distribution of a plant pathogen using a stochastic optimization   process which is epidemiologically motivated. Based on an initial   sample, the method simulates the individual spread processes of a   pathogen between patches of host to generate optimized spatial   distribution maps. The method was tested on data sets of Huanglongbing   of citrus and was compared with a kriging method from the field of   geostatistics using the well-established kappa statistic to quantify map   accuracy. Our method produced accurate maps of disease distribution with   kappa values as high as 0.46 and was able to outperform the kriging   method across a range of sample sizes based on the kappa statistic. As   expected, map accuracy improved with sample size but there was a high   amount of variation between different random sample placements (i.e.,   the spatial distribution of samples). This highlights the importance of   sample placement on the ability to estimate the spatial distribution of   a plant pathogen and we thus conclude that further research into   sampling design and its effect on the ability to estimate disease   distribution is necessary.},

Stepwise regression and   canonical correlation analysis revealed that CMD was positively   correlated with increasing numbers of weeds and with cultivar mixtures.   Cassava bacterial blight (CBB) was particularly severe in all ecozones   of Benin, but rare in Ghana. Cassava in the savanna zones of Benin was   heavily diseased with an incidence of 34.5-84.1\% and a high percentage   of plants showing systemic symptoms, while CBB was not observed in the   rainforest (RF) zone and only sporadically in the coastal savanna zone   of Ghana.

Disease progress was assessed in 12-18 sections   per plot and yields determined from the same sections. In 2000, plot   size was 3 x 10 m and there were no disease reductions apparently due to   interplot interference. In 2001 and 2002, with plot sizes of 6 x 18 and   6 x 36 m in strip-cropped potatoes, disease was significantly reduced by   9-20\% and 4-12\%, respectively, compared to pure stands of potato, with   the greatest reductions in plots planted perpendicular to the wind and   neighboured by grass-clover. The most important factors contributing to   disease reduction were loss of inoculum outside of the plots and barrier   effects of neighbouring non-potato hosts. Only 0-20\% of the overall   yield variation could be explained by the area under the disease   progress curve, depending on cultivar and year. In one year disease   effects on the yield of a moderately resistant cultivar were higher than   on the yield of a susceptible cultivar. This was probably caused by   differences in bulking behaviour. Nutrient limitation appeared to be   more important than disease in reducing yields. Yields in the edge   potato rows directly neighboured by cereals were significantly reduced   in all 3 years, but competition by cereals did not change the   disease-yield-loss relationship. Strip intercropping might be a useful   component in an overall management strategy to reduce incoming late   blight inoculum.},

The thermal coadaptation hypothesis predicts that (1) ectotherms experiencing a narrow range of body temperatures in the wild will evolve to perform well over a narrow range of body temperatures and that (2) the optimal temperature for performance will be equal to the preferred body temperature of the species.
2.
We tested the predictions of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis with black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) and northern water snakes (Nerodia sipedon) because black rat snakes experience lower and more variable body temperatures than northern water snakes at our study site.
3.
We measured swimming speed, tongue-flicking speed, and striking speed in black rat snakes, and swimming speed and tongue-flicking speed in northern water snakes.
4.
Adult water snakes generally had narrower performance breadths and higher optimum performance temperatures than adult black rat snakes.
5.
Performance breadths were the same for swimming, tongue flicking, and striking within adult black rat snakes, but performance optima for these behaviours differed significantly. Performance breadths differed and performance optima were the same for swimming and tongue flicking within adult northern water snakes.
6.
The relative swimming performance of neonates of the two species was similar in breadth to that of adults, but the thermal optimum for neonate black rat snakes was higher than that of adults.
7.
Overall, our results provided support for the thermal coadaptation hypothesis.},

	issn = {1684-5615},
	abstract = {Water yam ( Dioscorea alata L.) is the most widely cultivated yam   species globally. The major limitation to the profitable and sustainable   production of  D. alata is its susceptibility to anthracnose disease.   The availability of resistant varieties could potentially form the   cornerstone of an integrated management strategy for yam anthracnose;   however, anthracnose resistance breeding is hampered by the dearth of   knowledge on pathogen identity and diversity. Four forms of    Colletotrichum are now known to be associated with foliar anthracnose of   yam: the slow-growing grey (SGG), the fast-growing salmon (FGS), the   fast-growing olive (FGO), and the fast-growing grey (FGG) forms. The   close phylogenetic relationship of the first three forms to reference   isolates of  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and the fact that only   strains of these forms have been observed to induce typical anthracnose   symptoms on  D. alata, recently confirmed that  C. gloeosporioides is   the causal agent of yam anthracnose disease. The FGG form possibly   represents a distinct, endophytic, species as indicated by   morphological, biological and molecular criteria. Previous research   emphasized epidemiology and control but limited progress was made in   understanding yam anthracnose disease based on this classical approach.   Molecular approaches have started to unravel the systematics and ecology   of  Colletotrichum strains associated with yam anthracnose, as well the   population biology of  C. gloeosporioides on yam. Sexual recombination   is a likely mechanism contributing to the high genetic diversity of  C.   gloeosporioides in yam-based cropping systems. Studies have been   initiated to understand the mechanisms that generate genetic variation   in  C. gloeosporioides, and to gain some insight into the biochemistry   of the interactions between the pathogen and yam. Our thesis in this   article is that integrating traditional and molecular approaches to   understanding  C. gloeosporioides systematics, epidemiology and   population genetics will lead to a much better understanding of yam   anthracnose disease, and thus to the development of effective and   sustainable control measures. Research successes and challenges are   discussed, as well as their implications for future studies on pathogen   evolutionary potential, anthracnose resistance breeding, and the   deployment of resistance genes.},

The effects of inoculation methods (paint brush and spray), and disease   scoring methods [individual leaf area (ILA) and whole plant area (WPA)]   were also assessed. Spray inoculation resulted in rapid infection and   higher variations among yam genotypes, leading to earlier discrimination   of genotypes than with the paintbrush method. Both the ILA and WPA   scoring methods showed variation among yam genotypes, and association   between the two methods gave a high positive correlation (r {\textgreater} 0.90).   However, the WPA was faster and had the advantage of detecting   differences in reactions of yam genotypes to less aggressive pathogen   isolates to which the ILA method showed no variation. A single disease   evaluation at 7 days after inoculation was as good as the area under the   disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the disease progress rate (R-d)   derived from multiple evaluations. However, a significant time-genotype   interaction, suggests a need for more than a single assessment for   effective comparison of genotypes. AUDPC derived from two assessments (5   and 7 DAI) was better than AUDPC from three assessments (5, 7 and 9 DAI)   in separating genotypes reactions to a less aggressive pathogen isolate.   This study showed that the use of spray inoculation method, the WPA   scoring method, and AUDPC derived from two assessments (5 and 7 DAI)   provided best conditions for evaluating yam genotypes for levels of   anthracnose resistance with the tissue culture-derived whole plant   assay.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how the model can be fitted to vital rates (i.e., rates associated with development, survival, hatching, and oviposition) of the two-spotted spider mite ( Tetranychus urticae (Koch)) exposed to different constant temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37.5°C. SANDY was incorporated into an age-, stage- and sex-structured dynamic model, which was fitted to cohort life-tables of T. urticae conducted at five constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C). Age- and temperature-dependent vital rates for the three main stages (eggs, immatures, and adults) constituting the life-cycle of mites were adequately described by the SANDY model. The modeling approach allows for simulating the growth of a population in a variable environment. We compared the predicted net reproductive rate ( R0 ) and intrinsic rate of natural increase ( r m ) at fluctuating temperatures with empirical values obtained from life-table experiments conducted at temperatures that changed with a daily amplitude (±0, ±3, ±6, ±9, and ±12°C) around an average of 22°C. Results show that R0 decreases with increasing amplitude, while r m is more robust to variable temperatures. An advantage of SANDY is that the same simple mathematical expression can be applied to describe all the vital rates. Besides, the approach is not confined to modeling the influence of a single factor on population growth but allows for incorporating the combined effect of several limiting factors, provided that the combined effect of the factors is multiplicative.},

An on-farm trial was conducted   during the 1988-1989 and 1989-1990 seasons (October-August) in Nigeria   to determine the effect of time of mulching (October-February) on the   hydrothermal regime and emergence, growth and tuber yield of white yam.   Application of 12.5 mg ha(-1) of dry Eupatorium odoratum L. (Syn.   Chromolaena odorata L.) mulch on top of the mounds significantly   improved soil moisture content of the 15 cm surface layer by 50-120 g   kg(-1) and decreased the maximum soil temperature by 2-7 degrees C at 15   cm depth in the early growing season (March-April). The emergence and   development of yam seedlings were significantly lower in unmulched plots   than in mulch-treated plots. Mulching significantly increased tuber   yield by about 10-15 mg ha(-1) season(-1). Plots mulched in   October-December were more moist by 20-60 g kg(-1) and cooler by 1-3   degrees C, and had 27-44\% greater emergence than those mulched in   January or February. The number of leaves per plant, vine diameter and   leaf area index were also significantly greater in plots mulched in   October-December than plots mulched in January or February.   Consequently, shoot dry weight was about 28-36\% greater in yam mulched   in October-December than in yam mulched in February. However, the time   of mulching had no effect on soil moisture of the surface layer at the   beginning of the rainy season (April), on yam emergence in May and on   tuber yield and yield components. Although time of mulching did not   significantly affect tuber yield, the increase (10-15\%) in the tuber   yield of yam mulched in December-February compared to the yam mulched in   October or November was considerable. It was concluded that yam planted   in October, just before the rain stops, can be mulched in January or   February without detrimental effect on emergence, growth and tuber   yield.

	abstract = {Seventy-seven studies reporting Fusarium head blight disease index (Y;   mean percentage of diseased spikelets per spike) and wheat yield (W;   MT/ha) were analyzed to determine the relationship between W and Y, and   to assess the degree of variation for the relationship among studies. A   linear random-coefficient model-comprising a population-average   intercept and slope, a random residual term, and random effects of study   on the intercept and slope (best linear unbiased predictors; BLUPs)-was   successfully fitted to the data using maximum likelihood. From the   predicted random effects, study-specific intercepts and slopes were   obtained, and both population-average and subject-specific predictions   of yield were determined. The estimated population-average intercept   (expected yield when disease symptoms were not present) was 4.10 MT/ha,   and the population-average slope was 0.038 MT/ha per unit increase of   disease index. Wheat class had a significant effect on the intercept but   not on the slope, with soft-red winter wheat having, on average, 0.85   MT/ha higher yield than spring wheat. Based on the estimates of the   among-study variances, there was high variation in the effects of study   on the intercept, but substantially lower variation in the effects of   study on the slope. Thus, although one cannot predict with accuracy the   actual wheat yield in a field or plot based on disease index using   population-average results, one can predict with accuracy the decline in   yield at a given level of disease index using the population-average   slope. Through the modeling results, predicted relative yield (as a   percentage of yield when disease is not present) can be determined, as   well as predicted disease index at which a prespecified level of yield   (or yield loss) is expected to occur. The predicted reduction in yield   on a percentage scale was greater for spring than for soft-red winter   wheat, on average, because of the lower estimated intercept in absolute   units for spring wheat.},

	abstract = {One of the principal challenges in epidemiological modeling is to   parameterize models with realistic estimates for transmission rates in   order to analyze strategies for control and to predict disease outcomes.   Using a combination of replicated experiments, Bayesian statistical   inference, and stochastic modeling, we introduce and illustrate a   strategy to estimate transmission parameters for the spread of infection   through a two-phase mosaic, comprising favorable and unfavorable hosts.   We focus on epidemics with local dispersal and formulate a spatially   explicit, stochastic set of transition probabilities using a percolation   paradigm for a susceptible-infected (S-I) epidemiological model. The S-I   percolation model is further generalized to allow for multiple sources   of infection including external inoculum and host-to-host infection. We   fit the model using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo   simulation to successive snapshots of damping-off disease spreading   through replicated plant populations that differ in relative proportions   of favorable and unfavorable hosts and with time-varying rates of   transmission. Epidemiologically plausible parametric forms for these   transmission rates are compared by using the deviance information   criterion. Our results show that there are four transmission rates for a   two-phase system, corresponding to each combination of infected donor   and susceptible recipient. Knowing the number and magnitudes of the   transmission rates allows the dominant pathways for transmission in a   heterogeneous population to be identified. Finally, we show how failure   to allow for multiple transmission rates can overestimate or   underestimate the rate of spread of epidemics in heterogeneous   environments, which could lead to marked failure or inefficiency of   control strategies.},

Such understanding and description of epidemics   can lead directly to the development and evaluation of efficient control   strategies and tactics. Mathematical and statistical models are key   tools of the epidemiologist. Recent advances in statistics, including   linear and nonlinear mixed models, are allowing a more appropriate   matching of data type and experimental (or survey) design to the   statistical model used for analysis, in order to meet the objectives of   the investigator. Coupled ordinary and partial differential equations,   as well as simpler growth-curve equations, are especially useful   deterministic models for representing plant disease development in   fields in time and space over single seasons or many years, and their   use can lead to appraisal of control strategies through metrics such as   the basic reproduction number, a summary parameter that may be   calculated for many general epidemic scenarios. Recently, compelling   arguments have been made for the use of Bayesian decision theory in   developing and evaluating real-time disease prediction rules, based on   measured disease or weather conditions and either empirical or   mechanistic models for disease or control intervention. Through some   simple calculations of predictor accuracy and (prior) probability of an   epidemic (or the need for control), the success of any predictor can be   quantified in terms of the estimated probability of random observations   being epidemics when predicted to be epidemics or not epidemics.   Overall, despite the many contributions in epidemiology over the past   four decades, more effort is still needed to convince those outside of   epidemiology to more fully use epidemiological results and insights into   the development and evaluation of disease controls.},

The   relative contribution of different leaf layers to increase in CLS was   analyzed using a simple continuous-time model. The model was fitted to   data from two field trials in the Netherlands: one in an area with a   long history of CLS, the other in an area where CLS has only recently   established; in each case these were unsprayed and twice-sprayed   treatments. There were differences in the relative contribution of   different leaf layers to disease increase on the target leaf layer   according to the CLS history and whether the plants were sprayed or   unsprayed. In both field trials, parameter estimates giving the relative   contribution of the target leaf layer to disease increase at that leaf   layer were higher than those for the lower leaf layer. On only a few   occasions the contribution of an upper leaf layer to disease increase at   the target leaf layer was significant. Thus, CLS increase at the target   leaf layer was determined mainly by disease severity at that leaf layer   and to a lesser extent by disease at the lower leaf layer. Our   continuous-time model was also used to analyze CLS increase on an   individual sugar beet plant in relation to its own and its neighbor's   level of disease in field trials at five locations in the two CLS areas   over two years. In all field trials, the contribution of the target   plant itself to disease increase (auto-infection) was larger than that   of its neighboring plants (allo-infection). The overall analysis in the   two CLS areas also indicated a larger contribution of the target plant   to its disease increase than of neighboring plants, and this pattern was   also apparent in a pooled analysis across all sites. Thus, CLS increase   on a sugar beet plant was mainly determined by the disease severity on   that plant and to a lesser extent by its within-row neighboring plants.},

Considering disease spread across   multiple scales in a spatial hierarchy allows one to capture important   features of epidemics developing in space without using explicitly   spatialized variables. Thus, if the system under study is composed of   roots, plants, and planting hills, the effect of host spatial pattern   can be studied by varying the number of plants per planting hill. A   simulation model based on hierarchy theory was used to simulate the   effects of large versus small planting hills, low versus high level of   initial infections, and aggregated versus uniform distribution of   initial infections. The results showed that aggregating the initially   infected plants always resulted in slower epidemics than spreading out   the initial infections uniformly. Simulation results also showed that,   in most cases, disease epidemics were slower in the case of large host   aggregates (100 plants/hill) than with smaller aggregates (25   plants/hill), except when the initially infected plants were both   numerous and spread out uniformly. The optimal strategy for disease   control depends on several factors, including initial conditions. More   importantly, the model offers a framework to account for the interplay   between the spatial characteristics of the system, rates of infection,   and aggregation of the disease.},

Expression of   NAD(+)-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH2, encoding ammonia   synthesis) and the ammonia exporter AMET were induced at pH 4.0 to 4.5.   Conversely, ammonia uptake and transcript activation of the ammonia and   glutamate importers (MEP and GLT, respectively) and glutamine synthase   (GS1) were higher at pH 6.0 to 7.0. Accumulated ammonia in the wild-type   mycelium decreased during ambient alkalinization, concurrent with   increased GS1 expression. delta pac1 mutants of C. gloeosporioides,   which are sensitive to alkaline pH changes, showed upregulation of the   acid-expressed GDH2 and downregulation of the alkaline-expressed GS1,   resulting in 60\% higher ammonia accumulation inside the mycelium. delta   gdh2 strains of C. gloeosporioides, impaired in ammonia production,   showed 85\% inhibition in appressorium formation followed by reduced   colonization on avocado fruit (Persea americana cv.

Thus the   modulation of genes involved in ammonia metabolism and catabolism by C.   gloeosporioides is ambient pH-dependent.

In this study,   we were able to fingerprint each DNA accession sampled with one to three   ISSR primers and most accessions could be identified with a single   primer. We found population- and species-specific markers for each taxon   surveyed.

Despite its importance, its production is limited by anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.). The use of resistant yam varieties is the most reliable approach of management of this disease. The speed and precision of breeding can be improved by the development of genetic linkage maps which would provide the basis for locating and hence manipulating quantitative traits such as anthracnose resistance in breeding programmes. An F1 diploid population was developed by crossing 'Boutou' a female clone (with field resistance to anthracnose) with 'Pyramide' (susceptible). A linkage map was generated with 523 polymorphic markers from 26 AFLP primer combinations. The resulting map covered a total length of 1538 cM and included 20 linkage groups. It is the most saturated of all genetic linkage maps of yam to date. QTL analysis of anthracnose resistance was performed based on response to two isolates of C. gloeosporioides. Resistance to anthracnose appeared to be inherited quantitatively. Using a LOD significance threshold of 2.6 we identified a total of nine QTLs for anthracnose resistance. The phenotypic variance explained by each QTL ranged from 7.0 to 32.9\% whereas the total amount of phenotypic variation for anthracnose resistance explained by all significant QTLs varied from 26.4 to 73.7\% depending on the isolate and the variable considered. These QTLs displayed isolate-specific resistance as well as broad spectrum resistance. The availability of molecular markers linked to the QTLs of anthracnose resistance will facilitate marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes.},

The progress of these diseases   developing simultaneously on a susceptible sorghum cultivar planted in   inter- or intra-row mixtures of varying proportions with either maize or   resistant sorghum was monitored. The effects of host type and mixture   patterns on disease progress were compared by parameter estimates   derived from fitted Lotka-Volterra competition equations and nonlinear   logistic models. Competition coefficients were not significant and their   confidence intervals included zero in most cases, suggesting that   interactions between C. sublineolum and E. turcicum did not occur.   Mixtures of the susceptible sorghum with either the nonhost maize or the   resistant sorghum delayed the time when disease is first observed and   reduced the rate of disease progress and carrying capacity for both   anthracnose and leaf blight, with a more pronounced effect on the latter   disease. The lower efficacy of mixtures in reducing anthracnose was   attributed to an aggregated spatial pattern, coupled with higher rates   of progress for this disease. Intra-row mixtures were more efficient   than inter-row mixtures in reducing disease development in all years.   The implications of these observations for the management of sorghum   diseases under small-scale farming systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {Diseased individuals (e.g., leaves, plants) typically are clustered in   nature, resulting in greater heterogeneity or variability of disease   incidence than would be expected for a random pattern. To account for   this variability, as well as the binary nature of disease incidence and   the multiple sources of variation in designed experiments, a generalized   linear mixed model (GLMM) can be used to analyze collected data. GLMMs   are becoming more common in many disciplines and may be preferred over   analysis of variance for non-normally distributed data. We evaluated   several GLMMs for analyzing the incidence of Phomopsis leaf blight of   strawberry in relation to fungicide treatments in five experiments which   varied greatly in mean incidence and the differences in incidence   between treatments. The first model form accounted for heterogeneity   through the residual variance (i.e., the overdispersion parameter),   which was assumed to be either fixed for the experiment, or dependent on   either treatment or incidence. The second model form accounted for   heterogeneity explicitly through a within-plot sampling variance, which   was assumed to be either constant or dependent on treatment. All GLMMs   could be successfully fitted to the data in each experiment, but there   was weak evidence based on the conditional deviance and residual plots   that the residual-variance models were more appropriate than the   sampling-variance models. Model choice had only a minor effect on F   tests for treatment effects and significant differences between   treatment means. Based on ease of use and evaluation results, we   recommend that the simplest (fixed residual variance) model be used as   the first choice in analyzing disease incidence data using GLMMs.},

	abstract = {A new empirical equation for the sigmoid pattern of determinate growth,   'the beta growth function', is presented. It calculates weight (w) in   dependence of time, using the following three parameters: t(m), the time   at which the maximum growth rate is obtained; t(e), the time at the end   of growth; and w(max), the maximal value for w, which is achieved at   t(e). The beta growth function was compared with four classical   (logistic, Richards, Gompertz and Weibull) growth equations, and two   expolinear equations. All equations described successfully the sigmoid   dynamics of seed filling, plant growth and crop biomass production.   However, differences were found in estimating w(max). Features of the   beta function are: (1) like the Richards equation it is flexible in   describing various asymmetrical sigmoid patterns (its symmetrical form   is a cubic polynomial); (2) like the logistic and the Gompertz equations   its parameters are numerically stable in statistical estimation; (3)   like the Weibull function it predicts zero mass at time zero, but its   extension to deal with various initial conditions can be easily   obtained; (4) relative to the truncated expolinear equation it provides   more reasonable estimates of final quantity and duration of a growth   process. In addition, the new function predicts a zero growth rate at   both the start and end of a precisely defined growth period. Therefore,   it is unique for dealing with determinate growth, and is more suitable   than other functions for embedding in process-based crop simulation   models to describe the dynamics of organs as sinks to absorb   assimilates. Because its parameters correspond to growth traits of   interest to crop scientists, the beta growth function is suitable for   characterization of environmental and genotypic influences on growth   processes. However, it is not suitable for estimating maximum relative   growth rate to characterize early growth that is expected to be close to   exponential. (C) 2003 Annals of Botany Company.},

Ordinarily, the connection   topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely   random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie   somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of   networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks   'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that   these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have   small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them   'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world   phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)).   The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of   the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors   are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with   small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed,   computational power, and synchronizability.

	doi = {10.1094/PHYTO.2000.90.8.788},
	abstract = {A general approach was developed to predict the yield loss of crops in   relation to infection by systemic diseases. The approach was based on   two premises: (i) disease incidence in a population of plants over time   can be described by a nonlinear disease progress model, such as the   logistic or monomolecular; and (ii) yield of a plant is a function of   time of infection (t) that can be represented by the (negative)   exponential or similar model (zeta(t)). Yield loss of a population of   plants on a proportional scale (L) can be written as the product of the   proportion of the plant population newly infected during a very short   time interval (X'(t)dr) and zeta(t), integrated over the time duration   of the epidemic. L in the model can be expressed in relation to directly   interpretable parameters: maximum per-plant yield loss (alpha, typically   occurring at t = 0); the decline in per-plant loss as time of infection   is delayed (gamma; units of time(-1)); and the parameters that   characterize disease progress over rime, namely, initial disease   incidence (X-0), rate of disease increase (r; units of time(-1)), and   maximum (or asymptotic) value of disease incidence (K). Based on the   model formulation, L ranges from alpha X-0 to alpha K and increases with   increasing X-0, r, K, alpha, and gamma(-1). The exact effects of these   parameters on L were determined with numerical solutions of the model.   The model was expanded to predict L when there was spatial heterogeneity   in disease incidence among sites within a field and when maximum   per-plant yield loss occurred at a time other than the beginning of the   epidemic (t {\textgreater} 0). However, the latter two situations had a major impact   on L only at high values of r. The modeling approach was demonstrated by   analyzing data on soybean yield loss in relation to infection by Soybean   mosaic virus, a member of the genus Potyvirus, Based on model solutions,   strategies to reduce or minimize yield losses from a given disease can   be evaluated.},

Segregation of F-1 progeny fitted genetic ratios of 3:1. 5:1 (crosses A   and B) and 7:1 (,cross A) resistant: susceptible when inoculated with   the FGS strain. indicating that resistance is dominantly inherited and   suggesting that more than one gene controls the inheritance of   resistance to this strain in the accessions studied. When parental and   progeny lines of cross A were inoculated with an aggressive (SGG) strain   of the pathogen, all plants expressed a susceptible phenotype,   indicating strain-specific resistance in TDa 95/00328. Screening of 20   cultivars/landraces confirmed the high susceptibility of D. alata   accessions to the SGG strain and revealed the presence of apparent   strain non-specific resistance in TDa 85/00257. TDa 85/00257 and TDa   87/01091 which were resistant to the SGG strain, will be useful both as   sources of resistance and in the development of a host differential   series for D. alata.},

Pathogens sometimes   alter their exploitation strategies in response to defensive strategies   adopted by their host and vice versa. Nevertheless, most game-theoretic   models developed to explain the evolution of pathogen and host   characteristics assume that no such plasticity occurs. Allowing for   phenotypic plasticity in these models is difficult because one must   focus on the evolution of pathogen and host reaction norms, and then   allow for the potentially indefinite reciprocal changes in pathogen and   host behaviour that occur during an infection as a result of their   interacting reaction norms. Here, we begin to address these issues for a   simple host-pathogen system in which the pathogen exhibits a level of   virulence and the host exhibits a level of immune clearance. We find,   quite generally, that plasticity promotes the evolution of higher levels   of cooperation, in this case leading to reduced levels of both virulence   and clearance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The population   structure and genetic diversity were examined in the coat protein gene   by IC-RT-PCR-RFLP analysis with EcoRI and StyI, and nucleotide   sequencing, respectively.

Comparative   nucleotide diversity among population subsets implied a lack of genetic   differentiation according to host (transgenic vs conventional) or field   site for most restrictotypes (117 of 18 and 13 of 18) and for haplotypes   in most phylogenetic groups (seven of eight and six of eight),   respectively.

The model differs from those reported by other workers in three   respects. First, variables (such as weather, host resistance and   inoculum pressure) that affect disease risk are integrated in their   effect on disease progress. The agronomic and meteorological data called   for are restricted to those commonly available to growers by their own   observations and from meteorological service networks. Second, field   observations during the growing season can be used both to correct   current estimates of disease severity and to modify parameters that   determine predicted severity. Third, pathogen growth and symptom   expression are modelled to allow the effects of fungicides to be   accounted for as protectant activity (reducing infections that occur   postapplication) and eradicant activity (reducing growth of   presymptomatic infections). The model was tested against data from a   wide range of sites and varieties and was shown to predict the expected   level of disease sufficiently accurately to support fungicide treatment   decisions.},

Instead, for bacteria, steep convex curves are observed on an Arrhenius plot at the low- and high-temperature ends of the biokinetic range, with a region towards the middle of the growth range loosely approximating linearity. This central region has been considered by microbiologists to be the “normal physiological range” for bacterial growth, a concept whose meaningfulness we now question. We employ a kinetic model incorporating thermodynamic terms for temperature-induced enzyme denaturation, central to which is a term to account for the large positive heat capacity change during unfolding of the proteins within the bacteria. It is now widely believed by biophysicists that denaturation of complex proteins and/or other macromolecules is due to hydrophobic hydration of non-polar compounds. Denaturation is seen as the process by which enthalpic and entropic forces becomes imbalanced both at high and at low temperatures resulting in conformational changes in the enzyme structure that expose hydrophobic amino acid groups to the surrounding water molecules. The “thermodynamic” rate model, incorporating the heat capacity change and its effect on the enthalpy and entropy of the system, fitted 35 sets of data for psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria well, resulting in biologically meaningful estimates for the important thermodynamic parameters. As these results mirror those obtained by biophysicists for globular proteins, it appears that the same or a similar mechanism applies to bacteria as applies to proteins.},

Inoculum abundance was quantified as the daily number of   colony forming units per spike (CFU/spike). A total of 49 individual   weather variables for 24-h periods were generated from measurements of   ambient weather data. Polynomial distributed lag regression analysis,   followed by linear mixed model analysis, was used to (i) identify   weather variables significantly related to log-transformed CFU/spike   (the response variable; Y), (ii) determine the time window (i.e., lag   length) over which each weather variable affected Y, (iii) determine the   form of the relationship between each weather variable and Y (defined in   terms of the polynomial degree for the relationship between the   parameter weights for the weather variables and the time lag involved),   and (iv) account for location-specific effects and random effects of   years within locations on the response variable. Both location and year   within location affected the magnitude of Y, but there was no consistent   trend in Y over time. Y on each day was significantly and simultaneously   related to weather variables on the day of sampling and on the 8 days   prior to sampling (giving a 9-day time window). The structural   relationship corresponded to polynomial degrees of 0, 1, or 2, generally   showing a smooth change in the parameter weights and time lag. Moisture-   (e.g., relative humidity-) related variables had the strongest   relationship with Y, but air temperature-and rainfall-related variables   also significantly affected Y. The overall marginal effect of each   weather variable on Y was positive.

	abstract = {Prioritizing research for crop health management is critical in times of rapid agricultural changes. A generic model for plant diseases, EPIRICE, was developed and coupled to a geographic information system (GIS) in order to map simulated potential epidemics in rice globally. EPIRICE encompasses different hierarchy levels of a growing crop canopy: disease-sites on a leaf, whole leaves, tillers, plants, crop stand, world regions, and world. Five widely different diseases were considered, caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses, which have different disease-site and epidemiological attributes. EPIRICE is a simple Suscept-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model, parameterized using literature data for each of the five diseases, and combined with a few, simplified, characteristics of the growing crop (establishment, growth, senescence). Simulated outputs were tested against published disease progress curves, using visual and statistical, parametric and non-parametric, methods. Despite its simplicity, the model generates potential disease progress curves that concur with the literature. The model was linked to a GIS involving crop establishment date and daily climate data over a 12-year period of time. Successive epidemics were simulated at locations across the world, and their means and variances at each location were analyzed. Using rice as a model crop system, our results provide a proof of concept that it is possible to (1) use the same model (2) at different levels of plant and crop hierarchy, in order to (3) simulate and map potential plant disease epidemics globally. Further developments of this approach are discussed. The study also underscores the dearth of publicly available field data.},

Almond, citrus, lupin, olive and strawberry are some of the crops in   which C acutatum diseases are economically important. With the   application of molecular markers and diagnostic PCR over the last 10-15   years, C. acutatum was identified as a major pathogen on a number of   hosts instead of or along with C. gloeosporioides. C. acutatum displays   high levels of genotypic and phenotypic diversity. The global   populations of this cosmopolitan pathogen fit into at least eight   distinct molecular groups, A1-A8, which show some degree of correlation   with the morphological characteristics and varying patterns of host   association and geographical distribution. The pathogen has complex   epidemiology, exhibiting pathogenic and non-pathogenic lifestyles on   target hosts, non-target crops and weeds. C. acutatum populations also   show pathogenic variability and cross-infection potential in relation to   a number of hosts. Molecular genetic tools are being developed to   investigate the pathogenicity mechanisms of this key pathogen. This   article mainly focuses on the global population diversity in C acutatum,   pathogen epidemiology and diagnosis, host colonization processes, and   the development of tools for the identification and analysis of genes   associated with pathogenicity. Background information on the pathogen   origin, host range, disease symptoms and disease management strategies   is also provided.},

	abstract = {A modeling Study was carried out into pea-barley intercropping in   northern Europe. The two objectives were (a) to compare pea-barley   intercropping to sole cropping in terms of grain and nitrogen yield   amounts and stability, and (b) to explore options for managing   pea-barley intercropping systems in order to maximize the biomass   produced and the grain and nitrogen yields according to the available   resources, such as light, water and nitrogen. The study consisted of   simulations taking into account soil and weather variability among three   sites located in northern European Countries (Denmark, United Kingdom   and France), and using 10 years of weather records. A preliminary stage   evaluated the STICS intercrop model's ability to predict grain and   nitrogen yields of the two species, using a 2-year dataset from trials   conducted at the three sites. The work was carried out in two phases,   (a) the model was run to investigate the potentialities of intercrops as   compared to sole crops, and (b) the model was run to explore options for   managing pea-barley intercropping, asking the following three questions:   (i) in order to increase light capture, Would it be worth delaying the   sowing dates of one species? (ii) How to manage sowing density and seed   proportion of each species in the intercrop to improve total grain yield   and N use efficiency? (iii) How to optimize the use of nitrogen   resources by choosing the most suitable preceding crop and/or the most   appropriate soil? It was found that (1) intercropping made better use of   environmental resources as regards yield amount and stability than sole   cropping, with a noticeable site effect, (2) pea growth in intercrops   was strongly linked to soil moisture, and barley yield was determined by   nitrogen uptake and light interception due to its height relative to   pea, (3) sowing barley before pea led to a relative grain yield   reduction averaged over all three sites, but sowing strategy must be   adapted to the location, being dependent on temperature and thus   latitude, (4) density and species proportions had a small effect on   total grain yield, underlining the interspecific offset in the use of   environmental growth resources which led to similar total grain yields   whatever the pea-barley design, and (5) long-term strategies including   mineralization management through organic residue supply and rotation   management were very valuable, always favoring intercrop total grain   yield and N accumulation.

Field   experiments were conducted on organically managed land in 2004 and 2005   and three representative intercrop systems were tested: wheat with other   cereals [oats (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and spring   rye (Secale cereale L.)]; wheat and noncereal seed crops (flax [Linum   usitatissimum L.], field pea [Pisum sativum L.], oriental mustard   [Brassicajuncea L.]); and wheat and cover crops (red clover [Trifolium   pratense L.], hairy vetch [Vicia villosa L.], annual ryegrass [Lolium   multiflorum Lam.]). The cereal intercrop systems provided no consistent   yield benefit over wheat monocultures. Results from noncereal-wheat   intercrops were variable. Wheat-flax reduced the wheat crop to   unacceptable levels but was capable of reducing wheat flag leaf disease   levels. Wheat-field pea resulted in the lowest disease levels, yet had   inconsistent yields, and more weeds than wheat monoculture.   Wheat-mustard did riot reduce weeds or diseases, but it was capable of   high grain yields and net returns, though usually hampered by flea   beetle (Phyllotreta cruciferae) attack. The effect of cover crops on   wheat was affected by environment. Wheat-red clover and wheat-hairy   vetch did demonstrate the ability to maintain high wheat grain yield in   certain site-years.

There was extensive diversity in the   pathogen population from Brazil, Colombia, China, and India. The   Australian pathogen population was least diverse probably due to its   geographical isolation and effective quarantine. The extensive diversity   in China and India means that threats from exotic pathogen races to   Stylosanthes pastures can potentially come from countries outside the   South American center of origin. In Brazil and India, both with native   Stylosanthes populations, a high level of genetic differentiation in the   pathogen population was associated with sites where native or   naturalized host population was widely distributed. There was limited   genetic diversity at germplasm evaluation sites, with a large proportion   of isolates having identical haplotypes. This contrasts recent   pathogenicity results for 78 of the Brazilian isolates that show hot   spots of complex races are more common around research stations where   host germplasm are tested, but few are found at sites containing wild   host populations.

	abstract = {A spatiotemporal, integrodifference equation model of the potato late   blight pathosystem is described. Formerly, the model was used in a   theoretical context to analyze and predict epidemic dynamics in   spatially heterogeneous mixtures of host genotypes. The model has now   been modified to reflect a research interest in interactions between   genotype, environment, landscape, and management. New parameter values   describing host-pathogen interactions were determined and new   environment-pathogen relationships included. A new analytical equation   describing lesion expansion and associated necrosis has also been   developed. These changes prompted a need to assess the quality of model   predictions. Cultivar-isolate-specific interactions were characterized   in the model using three quantitative components of resistance:   infection efficiency, lesion growth rate, and sporulation intensity.   These were measured on detached potato leaflets in the laboratory.   Results of a sensitivity analysis illuminate the effect of different   quantitative components of resistance and initial conditions on the   shape of disease progress curves. Using the resistance components, the   epidemic process of lesion expansion was separated from the epidemic   process of lesion propagation providing two reference curves for   diagnosing observed epidemics. The spatial component of the model was   evaluated graphically in order to determine if realistic rates of focal   expansion for potato late blight are produced. In accordance with   theory, the radius of a predicted focus increased linearly with time and   a constant focal velocity was reached that compared well with published   experimental data. Validation data for the temporal model came from 20   late blight epidemics observed in field trials conducted in the   Netherlands in 2002 and 2004. The field data and model were compared   visually using disease progress curves, and numerically through a   comparison of predicted and observed t(5) and t(50) points ( time in   days until 5 and 50\% disease severity is reached, respectively) and   relative areas under the disease progress curve values. Temporal model   predictions were in close agreement with observational data and the   ability of the model to translate measured resistance components,   weather data, and initial conditions into realistic disease progress   curves without the need for calibration confirms its utility as a tool   in the analysis and diagnosis of epidemics.},

	abstract = {The nature of pathogen transport mechanisms strongly determines the   spatial pattern of disease and, through this, the dynamics and   persistence of epidemics in plant populations. Up to recently, the range   of possible mechanisms or interactions assumed by epidemic models has   been limited: either independent of the location of individuals   (mean-field models) or restricted to local contacts (between nearest   neighbours or decaying exponenially with distance). Real dispersal   processes are likely to lie between these two extremes, and many are   well described by long-tailed contact kernels such as power laws. We   investigate the effect of different spatial dispersal mechanisms on the   spatio-temporal spread of disease epidemics by simulating a stochastic   Susceptible-infective model motivated by previous data analyses. Both   long-term stationary behaviour (in the presence of a control or recovery   process) and transient behaviour (which varies widely within and between   epidemics) are examined. We demonstrate the relationship between   epidemic size and disease pattern (characterized by spatial   autocorrelation), and its dependence on dispersal and infectivity   parameters. Special attention is given to boundary effects, which can   decrease disease levels significantly relative to standard, periodic   geometries in cases of long-distance dispersal. We propose and test a   definition of transient duration which captures the dependence of   transients on dispersal mechanisms. We outline an analytical approach   that represents the behaviour of the spatially-explicit model, and use   it to prove that the epidemic size is predicted exactly by the   mean-field model (in the limit of an infinite system) when dispersal is   sufficiently long ranged (i.e. when the power-law exponent a less than   or equal to 2).

	abstract = {Many fungal pathogens penetrate plant leaves from a specialized cell   called an appressorium. The rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea can   also penetrate synthetic surfaces such as poly(vinyl chloride). Previous   experiments have suggested that penetration requires an elevated   appressorial turgor pressure. In the present report we have used   nonbiodegradable Mylar membranes, exhibiting a range of surface   hardness, to test the proposition that penetration is driven by turgor.   Reducing appressorial turgor by osmotic stress inhibited penetration of   these membranes. The size of the turgor deficit required to inhibit   penetration was a function of the surface hardness. Penetration of the   hardest membranes was inhibited by small decreases in appressorial   turgor, while penetration of the softer membranes was sensitive only to   large decreases in turgor. Similarly, penetration of the host surface   was inhibited in a manner comparable to penetration of the hardest Mylar   membranes. Indirect measurements of turgor, obtained through osmotically   induced collapse of appressoria, indicated that the infection apparatus   can generate turgor pressures in excess of 8.0 MPa (80 bars). We   conclude that penetration of synthetic membranes, and host epidermal   cells, is accomplished by application of the physical force derived from   appressorial turgor.},

	abstract = {Colletotrichum spp. are casual agents of anthracnose on various   economically important crops. To cope with the pitfalls of identifying   the fungi by morphotaxonomic criteria, the application of heteroduplex   mobility assay (HMA) of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions as a   biochemical tool was explored. The ITS regions of 29 Colletotrichum   isolates including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Colletotrichum   acutatum, Colletotrichum musae, Colletotrichum graminicola,   Colletotrichum capsici, Colletotrichum dematium, Colletotrichum   lindemuthianum and three unidentified species of Colletotrichum, were   PCR amplified. Comparison of the ITS sequences from 15 Colletotrichum   isolates revealed a greater DNA divergence within ITS1 region than that   within ITS2. The DNA distance and sequence identity within intra-species   ranged from 0.0 to 1.1\% and from 98.9 to 100\%, respectively; whereas   those within inter-species ranged from 1.46 to 13.43\% and 90.02 to   98.56\%, respectively. From the correlation of DNA distance and relative   heteroduplex mobility observed among 15 reference isolates, a formula   for estimation of distances of a tested DNA sequence was developed for   estimation of DNA distances of a compared strain. The phylogenetic   analysis of ITS regions of 29 Colletotrichum isolates using DNA distance   inferred from relative heteroduplex mobility divided them into 5   distinctive species groups, namely CG, CA, CC, CM and CL, similar to   that assembled based on DNA sequences analysis. Our results show that   HMA of ITS regions is a relatively rapid and convenient method for   species-specific identification of Colletotrichum spp. The potential use   of the established techniques for identification of anthracnose and even   other fungal diseases are discussed.},

Due to the variability of black spot symptoms, positive identification solely on the basis of visual inspection is difficult, especially when lesions lack pycnidia (fruiting bodies of the anamorph Phyllosticta citricarpa). As an aid to visual inspection of symptoms, we have developed a method for detection of G. citricarpa using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) which can be used to confirm the presence of G. citricarpa in black spot lesions, including those lacking pycnidia. The LAMP assay can be used to test crude extracts prepared directly from lesions on fruit, and the entire test can be completed in less than 40 min, making it faster than previously described PCR-based methods for detection of G. citricarpa. The method is sufficiently simple to allow deployment of the test in the field, for example in the course of import inspections. Recent years have seen the description of a number of newly recognised species in the genus Phyllosticta that are associated with citrus. As new species emerge, and the taxonomy of the genus is resolved, it will be important to periodically re-evaluate the performance of DNA-based methods for detection of G. citricarpa, including the LAMP assay described here, such that the accuracy of diagnosis can be assured.},

	doi = {10.1094/PHYTO-95-0092},
	abstract = {In this study, a simple generic infection model was developed for   predicting infection periods by fungal foliar pathogens. The model is   designed primarily for use in forecasting pathogens that do not have   extensive epidemiological data. Most existing infection models require a   background epidemiological data set, usually including laboratory   estimates of infection at multiple temperature and wetness combinations.   The model developed in this study can use inputs based on subjective   estimates of the cardinal temperatures and the wetness duration   requirement. These inputs are available for many pathogens or may be   estimated from related pathogens. The model uses a temperature response   function which is scaled to the minimum and optimum values of the   surface wetness duration requirement. The minimum wetness duration   requirement (W-min) is the number of hours required to produce 20\%   disease incidence or 5\% disease severity on inoculated plant parts at a   given temperature. The model was validated with published data from 53   controlled laboratory studies, each with at least four combinations of   temperature and wetness. Validation yielded an average correlation   coefficient of 0.83 and a root mean square error of 4.9 h, but there was   uncertainty about the value of the input parameters for some pathogens.   The value of W-min varied from 1 to 48 h and was relatively uniform for   species in the genera Cercospora, Alternaria, and Puccinia but less so   for species of Phytophthora, Venturia, and Colletotrichum.   Operationally, infection models may use hourly or daily weather inputs.   In the case of the former, information also is required to estimate the   critical dry-period interruption value, defined as the duration of a dry   period at relative humidities {\textless}95\% that will result in a 50\% reduction   in disease compared with a continuous wetness period. Pathogens were   classified into three groups based on their critical dry-period   interruption value. The infection model is being used to create risk   maps of exotic pests for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal   Plant Health and Inspection Service.},

Three isolates of C. acutatum   (Wolfskill, Surecrop, and 102) from California strawberry performed   similarly at the same temperature. The number of conidia recovered and   percent conidial germination were the highest at 5 degreesC with a soil   moisture level of 26.8\%.

When all I I differential equations were   fitted to two data sets, all models showed a similar goodness of fit,   although the shape parameter in some models could not be estimated very   precisely. With respect to useful characteristics (exponential   population growth at the beginning, ability to generate monomolecular   disease progression, and flexibility of the inflection point), the   models of Fleming, Kosman-Levy, Birch, Richards and Waggoner, and Rich   are recommended. Formulas were established to calculate the point of   inflection as well as the weighted absolute and relative rate,   respectively, depending on the shape and rate parameter. These formulas   allow transformation of the parameter values of one model into those of   another model in many cases.

When analyzing such "time-to-event" data,   survival analysis is superior to conventional statistical techniques   because it can accommodate censored observations, i.e., cases in which   the event has not occurred by the end of the study. Central to survival   analysis are two mathematical functions, the survivor function, which   describes the probability that an individual will "survive" (i.e., that   the event will not occur) until a given point in time, and the hazard   function, which gives the instantaneous risk that the event will occur   at that time, given that it has not occurred previously. These functions   can be compared among two or more groups using chi-square-based test   statistics. The effects of discrete or continuous covariates on survival   times can be quantified with two types of models, the accelerated   failure time model and the proportional hazards model. When applied to   longitudinal data on the timing of defoliation of individual blueberry   leaves in the field, analysis with the accelerated failure time model   revealed a significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) increased defoliation risk due to   Septoria leaf spot, caused by Septoria albopunctata. Defoliation   occurred earlier for lower leaves than for upper leaves, but this effect   was confounded in part with increased disease severity on lower leaves.},

	abstract = {Ascochyta blight is a serious disease affecting field peas. In France,   disease management relies mainly on scheduled chemical applications   without taking into account the actual disease risk. A better   understanding of the factors affecting disease onset would therefore   help in the timing of the first application. Field experiments involving   eight sowing dates between mid-September and mid-December were conducted   for two consecutive years. The seasonal dynamics of airborne inoculum   were investigated through trap plants. The weekly availability of   airborne primary inoculum was extremely low during autumn and winter and   was partially influenced by mesoclimatic conditions. Disease onset   occurred between mid-October and early March depending on the sowing   date. Generally, the later the sowing date, the longer the period   between sowing and disease onset. This was due to an increase in the   period between sowing and emergence. Disease onset was observed 14-35   days after emergence. A disease onset model based on the calculation of   weather-dependent daily infection values (DIVs) was established,   assuming that disease onset occurs once the temperature and moisture   requirements for incubation are met. Cumulative daily infection values   (cDIVs) were determined by sowing date and experiment through addition   of consecutive DIVs between emergence and disease onset. A frequency   analysis of cDIVs was performed to determine the 10th and 90th   percentiles of the distribution. An analysis of the observed and   predicted values showed that observed disease onset dates were almost   always included in the forecast window defined by these two percentiles.   This study is the first attempt to predict ascochyta blight onset in   field peas and should contribute to development of a more rational   fungicide application strategy.},

Development of leaves, flowers and pods over the period from the start   of stem extension to pod ripening was simulated. In the model, as new   plant parts developed from the apex during stem extension, infections on   plant initials were spread to the upper canopy by internode growth. In   addition, conidia produced by the pathogen were dispersed in the canopy   by rain-splash and produced infections at new sites. Vertical disease   spread was simulated for a number of different light leaf spot   distributions at the start of stem extension and with different crop   structures and rain durations. Results showed that stem extension was an   important factor in influencing vertical light leaf spot spread in the   model oilseed rape crop. Rain events contributed to the splash dispersal   of conidia to the plant apex and the resulting infections were directed   vertically by internode growth. Periods with frequent rain events in a   dense crop canopy (LAI constant with height) were most favorable for   light leaf spot progress. The upward spread of light leaf spot on winter   oilseed rape in field experiments showed the same trends as those   predicted by the model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights   reserved.},

Splash droplets   were collected in sheltered petri plates with a selective medium for   Collerotrichum, and colonies formed from conidia entrained in the   droplets were counted and used as the measure of dispersal. Colonies   were mostly confined to a 27-cm radius from the source, and density of   colonies decreased exponentially with the distance squared, as indicated   by the fit of a diffusion-type model to the data. Splash dispersal was   more affected by drop size distribution than rain intensity or other   properties of the generated rains. That is, there was a direct positive   relationship between total colonies over 61 min of rain for a circular   area with a 72-cm radius (Sigma) and the mass (volume) median diameter   of impacting drops (D-0') for four rain-simulation treatments.

Three series of models   were developed using different weather summaries. Of these, ANN models   with weather for the day of disease assessment and the previous 24 h   period had the highest prediction success, and models trained on data   from all sites within one continent correctly predicted disease severity   in the other continent on more than 75\% of days; the overall prediction   error was 21.9\% for the Australian and 22.1\% for the South American   model. Of the six cross-continent ANN models trained on pooled data for   five sites from two continents to predict severity for the remaining   sixth site, the model developed without data from Planaltina in Brazil   was the most accurate, with {\textgreater}85\% prediction success, and the model   without Carimagua in Colombia was the least accurate, with only 54\%   success. In common with multiple regression models, moisture-related   variables such as rain, leaf surface wetness and variables that   influence moisture availability such as radiation and wind on the day of   disease severity assessment or the day before assessment were the most   important weather variables in all ANN models. A set of weights from the   ANN models was used to calculate the overall risk of anthracnose for the   various sites. Sites with high and low anthracnose risk are present in   both continents, and weather conditions at centres of diversity in   Brazil and Colombia do not appear to be more conducive than conditions   in Australia to serious anthracnose development.},

Reduction in plant height due to anthracnose was   partially compensated for by growth enhancement at elevated CO2 in   Fitzroy but not in Seca. Anthracnose severity was reduced under elevated   CO2 although the reduction was only significant in Fitzroy. Delayed and   reduced germination, germtube growth and appressoria production were   partly responsible for the reduced severity. Despite an extended   incubation period, C. gloeosporioides developed sporulating lesions   faster and produced more spores per day within the same latent period at   high CO2 and ambient CO2. When Fitzroy seedlings grown at 700 ppm CO2   were exposed to pathogen inoculum under field conditions, they   consistently developed more severe anthracnose with more lesions than   seedlings grown at ambient CO2, The environmental variable, which   correlated most strongly with the dispersal and infection of C.   gloeosporioides spores in the field, was relative humidity in plant   canopy. We have shown that an enlarged Stylosanthes canopy under   elevated CO2 can trap more spores, which can lead to more severe   anthracnose under favorable weather. The implications of these findings   for perennial Stylosanthes pastures are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier   Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

After slow development   during early growth stages, sorghum anthracnose developed rapidly after   flowering. The logistic model provided a good statistical fit for   disease progress curves for sorghum anthracnose in Arkansas. Compared to   susceptible cultivars, the resistant cultivar had significantly lower   values for the standard area under the disease progress curve, a lower   upper asymptote, and delayed epidemic onset. However, there were no   significant differences in infection rate and the time of the inflection   points, the times at which the disease proportion equaled values of   one-half of upper asymptotes, among the three cultivars. The negative   exponential model more closely described disease gradients of sorghum   anthracnose than the inverse power law model. There were significant   differences in intercepts but not in slopes and half-distance between   the resistant and susceptible cultivars. The slopes of disease gradients   were significantly lower at 78 days after inoculation (DAI) than at 57   DAI on the three cultivars.

The model   quantifies the loss of healthy growing points of lupin in all 1-m(2)   subunits of a field throughout a growing season. The development of   growing points is modeled as a function of temperature using a 1-day   time step, and disease-induced compensatory growth is accounted for.   Dispersal of spores is simulated explicitly using Monte Carlo   techniques. Spread of spores occurs during rainfall events on a 1-h time   step. The distance traveled by spores is partially dependent on wind   speed and is generated by adding the values selected from half-Cauchy   distributions. The direction of travel of the spores is influenced by   wind direction. The model has been employed to produce a theoretical   assessment of damage from disease in two environments at five levels of   seed infection. It was calculated that in a susceptible lupin cultivar   with a 0.01\% initial seed infection. anthracnose would cause   approximately 15\% loss of healthy growing points in a high rainfall   environment in Western Australia. In a low rainfall environment, similar   damage would be unlikely even with a much higher (1\%) level of seed   infection.},

template simple sequence repeats (SSR) regions. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed and the method is compared with other molecular methods used in bryophyte population genetics including isozymes, RAPD, AFLP and RFLP. We further discuss how to optimize the PCR and the repeatability of ISSR.},

Forty accessions of D alata   were evaluated for the suitability of their tubers for the preparation   of two dominant food forms (boiled and pounded) as part of an effort to   identify potential parents for use in genetic improvement. Trained   panellists were presented with randomised, replicated and coded samples   of boiled yam tuber pieces and asked to rate them for mealiness, colour,   wetness, softness and taste. The sensory attributes considered for   pounded yam (dough from boiled and pounded tubers) were consistency,   colour, sheen, smoothness, stickiness, elasticity and hardness. Ratings   were based on hedonic scales. Cluster analysis revealed groupings of   accessions into eight and nine similarity clusters for boiled yam and   pounded yam respectively. The mean scores for general preference were   regressed on individual attribute scores. Mealiness, colour and taste   were important in the general preference for boiled yam. Consistency,   colour and stickiness determined the general preference for pounded yam.   Of the accessions, 67\% were identified as being suitable for preparation   as a boiled vegetable, while 55\% were assessed to be good for pounded   yam, based on the respective quality attributes evaluated.

We investigated   whether evolution on one host genotype traded off with performance on   others in long-term experimental populations of different genotypes of   the protozoan Paramecium caudatum, infected with the bacterial parasite   Holospora undulata. A total of nine parasite selection lines evolving on   three host genotypes and the ancestral parasite were tested in a   cross-infection experiment. We found that evolved parasites produced   more infections than did the ancestral parasites, both on host genotypes   they had evolved on (positive direct response to selection) and on   genotypes they had not evolved on (positive correlated response to   selection). On two host genotypes, a negative relationship between   direct and correlated responses indicated pleiotropic costs of   adaptation. On the third, a positive relationship suggested cost-free   adaptation. Nonetheless, on all three hosts, resident parasites tended   to be superior to the average nonresident parasite. Thus genotype   specificity (i.e., patterns of local adaptation) may evolve without   costs of adaptation, as long as direct responses to selection exceed   correlated responses.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the use of an electronic nose (EN) containing 13 conducting polymer gas sensors to discriminate between patterns of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants. The VOC patterns examined were produced by tomato, cucumber and pepper plants under both healthy and infected or infested conditions. Leaves from the plants were subjected to mechanical damage or pest and disease attacks (i.e. spider mites infested or mildew infected) and others were judged against undamaged healthy leaves. Support vector machines (SVMs) with linear, polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels were used to process and classify the raw data collected. The SVM illustrated an ability to discriminate between different VOC patterns and hence was able to classify correctly the infected leaves using the EN data. The results indicate that the array of 13 EN gas sensors can discriminate among VOC patterns from undamaged and artificially damaged leaves of the three plant species. This study demonstrates the potential application of such an EN technology coupled with suitable pattern recognition and signal processing methods to be used as a real time pest and disease detection system in the greenhouse environment.},

A previous study showed that isolates could be differentiated according   to vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs).

Furthermore, genetic relationships within and   between VCGs were examined using sequences of the intergenic spacer   region of rDNA.

The lowest risk pathogens are those with strict asexual   reproduction, low potential for gene flow, small effective population   sizes, and low mutation rates.

	abstract = {Many biologists use population models that are spatial, stochastic and   individual based. Analytical methods that describe the behaviour of   these models approximately are attracting increasing interest as an   alternative to expensive computer simulation. The methods can be   employed for both prediction and fitting models to data. Recent work has   extended existing (mean field) methods with the aim of accounting for   the development of spatial correlations. A common feature is the use of   closure approximations for truncating the set of evolution equations for   summary statistics. We investigate an analytical approach for spatial   and stochastic models where individuals interact according to a generic   function of their distance; this extends previous methods for lattice   models with interactions between close neighbours, such as the pair   approximation. Our study also complements work by Bolker and Pacala (BP)   [Theor. Pop. Biol. 52 (1997) 179; Am. Naturalist 153 (1999) 575]: it   treats individuals as being spatially discrete (defined on a lattice)   rather than as a continuous mass distribution; it tests the accuracy of   different closure approximations over parameter space, including the   additive moment closure (MC) used by BP and the Kirkwood approximation.   The study is done in the context of an susceptible-infected-susceptible   epidemic model with primary infection and with secondary infection   represented by power-law interactions. MC is numerically unstable or   inaccurate in parameter regions with low primary infection (or   density-independent birth rates). A modified Kirkwood approximation   gives stable and generally accurate transient and long-term solutions;   we argue it can be applied to lattice and to continuous-space models as   a substitute for MC. We derive a generalisation of the basic   reproduction ratio, R-0, for spatial models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science   Inc. All rights reserved.},

All taxa accepted within this clade are morphologically more or less typical of the broadly defined C. gloeosporioides, as it has been applied in the literature for the past 50 years. We accept 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides complex. These include C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. horii, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. psidii, C. siamense, C. theobromicola, C. tropicale, and C. xanthorrhoeae, along with the taxa described here as new, C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alatae, C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, C. salsolae, and C. ti, plus the nom. nov. C. queenslandicum (for C. gloeosporioides var. minus). All of the taxa are defined genetically on the basis of multi-gene phylogenies. Brief morphological descriptions are provided for species where no modern description is available. Many of the species are unable to be reliably distinguished using ITS, the official barcoding gene for fungi. Particularly problematic are a set of species genetically close to C. musae and another set of species genetically close to C. kahawae, referred to here as the Musae clade and the Kahawae clade, respectively. Each clade contains several species that are phylogenetically well supported in multi-gene analyses, but within the clades branch lengths are short because of the small number of phylogenetically informative characters, and in a few cases individual gene trees are incongruent. Some single genes or combinations of genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase, can be used to reliably distinguish most taxa and will need to be developed as secondary barcodes for species level identification, which is important because many of these fungi are of biosecurity significance. In addition to the accepted species, notes are provided for names where a possible close relationship with C. gloeosporioides sensu lato has been suggested in the recent literature, along with all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and its putative teleomorph Glomerella cingulata.

	abstract = {The complex interactions between rainfall-driven erosion processes and   rainfall characteristics, slope gradient, soil treatment and soil   surface processes are not very well understood. A combination of   experiments under natural rainfall and a consistent physical theory for   their interpretation is needed to shed more light on the underlying   processes. The present study demonstrates such a methodology. An   experimental device employed earlier in laboratory studies was used to   measure downslope rain splash and 'splash-creep', lateral splash,   upslope splash and rainfall-driven runoff transport (wash) from a highly   aggregated clay-rich oxisol exposed to natural rainfall in West Java,   Indonesia. Two series of measurements were made: the first with the soil   surface at angles of 0degrees, 5degrees, 15degrees and 40\% and the   second all at an angle of 5degrees but with different tillage and   mulching treatments. A number of rainfall erosivity indices were   calculated from rainfall intensity measurements and compared with   measured transport components. Overall storm kinetic energy correlated   reasonably well with sediment transport, but much better agreement was   obtained when a threshold rainfall intensity (20 turn h(-1)) was   introduced. Rain splash transport measurements were interpreted using a   recently developed theory relating detachment to sediment transport.   Furthermore, a conceptually sound yet simple wash transport model is   advanced that satisfactorily predicted observed washed sediment   concentrations. The lack of replication precluded rigorous assessment of   the effect of slope and soil treatment on erosion processes, but some   general conclusions could still be drawn. The results stress the   importance of experiments under conditions of natural rainfall.   Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

Only melanized appressoria were formed on mango   surfaces. In vitro experiments on membranes showed comparative   differences in physiological behaviour with temperature for two   Philippine isolates of C. gloeosporioides. The most stimulatory   temperature for production of appressoria differed in isolates I-2 and   I-4 (25 and 20 degrees C, respectively). At 30 degrees C more   appressoria became melanized than at lower temperatures, but the   frequency of formation of penetration pegs was highest at 25 degrees C.   Conidia of C. gloeosporioides germinated on cellophane membranes at   relative humidities as low as 95\%, but the percentage of conidia   germinating and forming appressoria increased as the RH approached 100\%.   Approximately 18\% of conidia of C. gloeosporioides I-2 held at 62 and   86\% RH for 4 weeks retained viability, and some were capable of forming   appressoria when placed at 100\% RH.

Conidial dispersal was assessed by counting colonies formed from   spore-bearing splash droplets deposited in sheltered petri plates   containing a selective medium. Colonies were converted to number of   conidia based on germination rates of spores on the media. The   interpolated total number of dispersed conidia over a 61 min rain and 72   cm from the point source (Sigma) was calculated. For all species, a rain   intensity of 30-mm/h resulted in significantly greater dispersal than an   intensity of 11-mm/h. C.fragariae had the lowest amount of spore   dispersal, and C. acutatum-O had the highest dispersal. C. acutatum-M   and C. gloeosporioides were intermediate in magnitude of conidial splash   dispersal. However, differences were directly attributed to differences   in spore density per fruit at the source. When Sigma was corrected for   source strength (Sigma(r)), the species were very similar, with only C.   acutatum-M having a mean Sigma(r) significantly less than the others.   Proportions and rates of spore removal (per minute) from source fruits   were higher for C. acutatum-O and C. gloeosporioides than for other   isolates. Wash-off rates of conidia deposited on healthy fruits were the   same for all species. Deposition flux density of spores that had been   uniformly sprayed over the entire soil surface of the experimental area   was affected by species. A significant difference in means was observed   between C. acutatum and C. fragariae-the latter had a somewhat lower   flux density.

At the opposite extreme, high-dimensional models that are   both individual-based and stochastic incorporate the distributed nature   of ecological interactions. In between, moment approximations have been   proposed that represent the effect of correlations on the dynamics of   mean quantities. As an alternative closer to the typical temporal models   used in ecology, we present here results on "modified mean-field   equations" for infectious disease dynamics, in which only mean   quantities are followed and the effect of heterogeneous mixing is   incorporated implicitly. We specifically investigate the previously   proposed empirical parameterization of heterogeneous mixing in which the   bilinear incidence rate SI is replaced by a nonlinear term kS(p)I(q),   for the case of stochastic SIRS dynamics on different contact networks,   from a regular lattice to a random structure via small-world   configurations. We show that, for two distinct dynamical cases involving   a stable equilibrium and a noisy endemic steady state, the modified   mean-field model approximates successfully the steady state dynamics as   well as the respective short and long transients of decaying cycles.   This result demonstrates that early on in the transients an approximate   power-law relationship is established between global (mean) quantities   and the covariance structure in the network. The approach fails in the   more complex case of persistent cycles observed within the narrow range   of small-world configurations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights   reserved.},

Most of the plants grow as green phenotype (DzW). Two further forms   differ in their leaf shape and leaf color. Whereas one type exhibits a   more pointed leaf shape in the upper part of the plant with leaves   appearing yellow-green with white stripes or hatchings (DzY), the other   type shows a more round leaf shape with an intensive yellow-green color   (DzT). These three plant types differ in their diosgenin content not   only in their rhizomes but also in the chloroplasts. In the rhizomes the   diosgenin content in the green form is 0.4\%, in the DzY-form 0.6\% and in   the DzT-form even 1.3\% of the dry weight. Furthermore, even in   chloroplasts of the green DzW-form and of the DzY-form the presence of   diosgenin was demonstrated. It occurs there as the epimeric form   yamogenin. The DzT-form contains no yamogenin in its chloroplasts.   Besides this, these plant forms differ in their chlorophyll and   carotenoid content and in their fatty acid composition. Carotenoids   increase from 1.3\% of total lipids in the green phenotype to 3.3\% in the   DzY- and to 4.2\% in the DzT-form. This increase refers to beta-carotene   as well as to lutein and neoxanthin. The chlorophyll content in the   green type is 8.1\% and lower in the DzY-form with 7\%. The highest   chlorophyll content is found in the DzT-form with 12\%. Fatty acids in   the DzY-form. and in the DzT-form have a more unsaturated character than   in the green phenotype. The content of the monoenoic acid   trans-hexadecenoic acid is considerably lower in both phenotypes when   compared to the green phenotype. In both phenotypes the quantity of   fatty acids with 16 carbon atoms is reduced, whereas fatty acids with 18   carbon atoms occur in higher concentration.   Cultivation of the green phenotype (DzW) at the three light intensities   of 10, 100 and 270 muE . m(-2) . sec(-1) leads to changes of the   diosgenin content in rhizomes, to an increase of leaf dry weight, to a   reduction of the grana structure in chloroplasts and therewith to a   decrease of the chlorophyll content.

We detected significant genetic variance within, and divergence among, populations. The ‘hotter is better’ hypothesis was not supported as the genetic correlations between optimal temperature (Topt) and maximum performance (zmax) were consistently negative.

According to recent phylogenetic data, suitable   molecular tools were developed for detection and genotyping. A reliable   and rapid molecular test is described using single-tube immunocapture   (IC)-RT-PCR combining the use of a monoclonal antibody able to recognise   all YMV serotypes and primers designed to take into account the whole   variability of YMV. Phylogenetic data were then used to develop an   uncoupled IC-RT-PCR procedure adapted to the genotyping of the three   major phylogenetic groups and the two recombinants implicated in the YMV   epidemics in the Caribbean and French Guiana. A third exploitation of   phylogenetic data was carried out with the development of a typing test   based on the analysis of short nucleotide sequences. The direct   sequencing of a 450 nts fragment constituted a reliable complementary   typing tool as the resulting information was quite similar to that   obtained with sequences of the complete coat protein gene. The approach,   consisting in a robust study of YMV variability followed by the use of   phylogenetic data to develop reliable detection and genotyping tools,   offers new perspectives for powerful molecular epidemiological studies.

	abstract = {Invasive alien plants play an important role in our changing world and have a considerable negative impact on ecosystems in many parts of the world. One effective control strategy involves the use of biocontrol agents which either damage the invasive alien plant itself or reduce the production of seeds. In this paper, we focus on seed-attacking biocontrol agents. To be able to predict the impact of biocontrol agents on the seed production pattern provides a way of comparing the impact of different biocontrol agents before they have actually been released. This becomes complex in systems where more than one biocontrol agent is present and where both depend on the same resource. In this paper, we examine a system consisting of two seed-attacking biocontrol agents (a midge and a weevil) and one invasive alien plant (Acacia cyclops). We used a non-spatial but temporal model to predict the impact of these biocontrol agents on flowering and seed set. We used a global sensitivity analysis (i.e. analysing the impact of several parameter simultaneously) to evaluate the impact of selected parameters which were considered uncertain but important. We could show that the system, even without biocontrol agents, fluctuates for most parameter sets between years, and that the fluctuations increased after the release of the biocontrol agents, although the number of seeds produced was, on average, substantially smaller. We found that the two biocontrol agents could usually not coexist, highlighting that special care needs to taken in selecting each additional biocontrol agent to avoid driving an already established biocontrol agent to extinction. These observations make a strong case for long-term monitoring after the release of biocontrol agent.},

These   mean-field or 'compartmental' models based on homogeneous mixing have   made, and continue to make, important contributions to the epidemiology   and the ecology of infectious diseases but fail to reproduce many of the   features observed for disease spread in contact networks. In this work,   we show that it is possible to incorporate the important effects of   network structure on disease spread with a mean-field model derived from   individual level considerations. We propose that the fundamental number   known as the basic reproductive number of the disease, R-0, which is   typically derived as a threshold quantity, be used instead as a central   parameter to construct the model from. We show that reliable estimates   of individual level parameters can replace a detailed knowledge of   network structure, which in general may be difficult to obtain. We   illustrate the proposed model with small world networks and the   classical example of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemics.},

Pre-penetration events of these tissues were similar, but   the production of secondary conidia (microcyclic conidiation) was   detected only on leaves. At the ultrastructural level, different stages   of maturation of appressoria were observed and described. In young   appressoria, the cell wall was composed of two layers and the plasma   membrane displayed a wavy appearance. In the following stage, the   appressorium developed a third electron-transparent layer between the   cell wall and the plasma membrane. This new electron-transparent   material was especially visible in the region of the appressorium near   the cuticle. The plasma membrane of this appressorium showed a smooth   appearance. Afterwards, a penetration peg emerged through the pore   penetrating the cuticle and reached the epidermal wall where it enlarged   to form an intramural infection vesicle. Both structures of infection,   the penetration peg and the intramural infection vesicle, produced   during the early phases of infection of strawbery tissues by C.   acutatum, have not been previously reported and confirm that its   invasion strategy is that of a subcuticular intramural pathogen. Once   the infection was well established, abundant subcuticular and intramural   hyphae were produced on petioles, causing severe degradation of the host   cell walls. Occasionally, the cuticle appeared disrupted in those   regions where the host walls were very degraded and dilated. Differences   between colonization of petioles and leaves were observed.},

	abstract = {RICEPEST, a model simulating yield losses due to several rice pests   (sheath blight, brown spot, sheath rot, bacterial leaf blight, stem   borers, brown plant hopper, defoliating insects, and weeds) under a   range of specific production situations of tropical Asia was developed.   The model was assessed, using: (1) combined data sets generated by a   series of test-experiments conducted in different sites of the   Philippines, India, and China; and (2) one additional, independent,   validation-experiment where a wide range of production situations and   injury profiles were manipulated at a single site. Model evaluation was   based on the analysis of two output variables: grain yield and relative   yield loss. The paper reports results of qualitative and quantitative   methods used to assess RICEPEST. Qualitative evaluation involved visual   examination of graphs where deviations (simulated minus observed) are   plotted against simulated values, and displaying an area of acceptance.   This method showed that, in general, RICEPEST accounted well for the   yield reducing effects of rice pests. Two areas for potential   improvement of RICEPEST were however, identified: the simulation of   damage caused by dead hearts in water-stressed environments, and the   simulation of damage caused by weeds. Quantitative evaluations made use   of equivalence- and chi(2)-tests. The equivalence tests rejected (Pless   than or equal to0.05) the hypothesis of difference between simulated and   observed yield and relative yield loss larger than a preset tolerance in   both test- and validation-experiments. Conversely, the chi(2)-tests did   not reject the hypothesis of difference in categorised simulated and   observed yields and relative yield losses (P less than or equal to 0.05)   in both test- and validation-experiments. RICEPEST proved to simulate   adequately yield losses and can be used as a tool to set research   priorities for rice crop protection in tropical Asia. (C) 2002 Elsevier   Science B.V.

Time-series analysis has appeared as an interesting approach to explore the dynamics of numerous diseases. Classical time-series methods can only be used for stationary time-series (in which the statistical properties do not vary with time). However, epidemiological time-series are typically noisy, complex and strongly non-stationary. Given this specific nature, wavelet analysis appears particularly attractive because it is well suited to the analysis of non-stationary signals. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach as an appropriate and elegant method for time-series analysis in epidemiological studies. The wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper based on epidemiological examples. In particular, the wavelet approach permits analysis of transient relationships between two signals and is especially suitable for gradual change in force by exogenous variables.},

However the genus contains several species complexes that encompass such   a broad range of morphological and pathological variation that the   species name is of relatively little use either to the taxonomist or   plant pathologist. Phylogenetic analyses, primarily based on variable   regions of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences, have indicated that these   species complexes comprise a variable number of identifiable   monophyletic clades. However rDNA sequences often are insufficiently   diverse to fully resolve such closely related lineages. A group of   isolates representing three species complexes (C. graminicola, C.   glaeosparioides kand C. acutatum) were analyzed by using the high   mobility group (HMG)-encoding sequence of the MATI-2 mating type   sequence, which has been shown in other fungi to be especially suitable   for distinguishing relationships among closely related groups. Results   were compared with those obtained from analysis of variable regions of   the rDNA as well as from standard morphological classification methods.   Results achieved through analysis of AMT1-2 sequences correlated well   with those obtained by analysis of rDNA sequences but provided   significantly better resolution among the various lineages.   Morphological traits, including hyphopodia size, colony appearance,   spore size, appresorial shape and size and host preference, frequently   were unreliable as indicators of phylogenetic association. Spore shape   and hyphopodia shape more often were useful for this purpose.},

	abstract = {Most mathematical models of plant disease epidemics ignore the and   phenology of the host crop. Unfortunately, reports of disease   development are often not accompanied by a simultaneous and commensurate   evaluation of crop development. However, the time scale for increases in   the leaf area of field crops is comparable to the time scale of   epidemics. This simultaneous development of host and pathogen has many   ramifications on the resulting plant disease epidemic. First, there is a   simple dilution effect resulting from the introduction of new healthy   leaf area with time. Often. measurements of disease levels are made pro   rata (per unit of host leaf area or total root length or mass). Thus,   host growth will reduce the apparent infection rate. A second, related   effect, has to do with the so-called "correction factor," which accounts   for inoculum falling on already infected tissue. This factor accounts   for multiple infection and is given by the fraction of the host tissue   that is susceptible to disease. As an epidemic develops, less and less   tissue is open to infection and the initial exponential growth slows.   Crop growth delays the impact of this limiting effect and, therefore,   tends to increase the rate of disease progress. A third and often   neglected effect arises when an increase in the density of susceptible   host tissue results in a corresponding increase in the basic   reproduction ratio, R-0, defined as the ratio of the total number of   daughter lesions produced to the number of original mother lesions. This   occurs when the transport efficiency of inoculum from infected to   susceptible host is strongly dependent on the spatial density of plant   tissue. Thus, crop growth may have a major impact on the development of   plant disease epidemics occurring during the vegetative phase of crop   growth. The effects that these crop growth-related factors have on plant   disease epidemics spread by airborne spores are evaluated using   mathematical models and their importance is discussed. In particular,   plant disease epidemics initiated by the introduction of inoculum during   this stage of development are shown to be relatively insensitive to the   time at which inoculum is introduced.},

	abstract = {Spread of strawberry anthracnose, resulting from the rain splash   dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia, was determined in field   plots by assessing fruit disease incidence at a range of distances from   an introduced point source of infected fruit with sporulating lesions.   Four within-row plant densities were established in replicated plots in   each of 2 years. A generalized linear model with a legit link function   and binomial distribution for incidence was used to quantify the effects   of distance and side of the row relative to the inoculum source, plant   density treatment, and their interactions on disease incidence. At all   assessment times, there was a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05)   decline in incidence with increasing distance from the spore source.   Moreover, row side had a significant effect, with the near side having   higher incidence than the far side. Plant density treatment had a   significant, but nonlinear, effect on incidence, with incidence   generally declining with increasing density. Side of the row relative to   the inoculum source and density treatment could affect the steepness of   the disease gradient (slope) as well as the overall level of disease   incidence, depending on the assessment time and year. The combined   effects of plant density and row side on the height and steepness of the   disease gradients could be measured using the predicted distance in   which incidence equals 10\% (d(10)). Estimated d(10) generally increased   in a nonlinear manner with decreasing plant density. Also, plant density   had a significant negative effect on the proportion of incident rain   that penetrated the canopy. In a separate study, plant density did not   consistently affect infection of fruit that had been placed within the   canopy immediately after being inoculated in the laboratory with a   controlled inoculum density, indicating that conditions favoring   infection were similar for the four densities. Thus, differences in mean   disease incidence and disease gradients among the treatments were mostly   due to differences in dispersal and not to other components of the   disease cycle. As previously reported for controlled studies using a   rain simulator, however, the effects of plant density on dispersal were   complex, and increasing density did not universally lead to decreasing   disease incidence.},

A simple multi-patch   (metapopulation) model for spatial heterogeneity in epidemics is   analysed and we examine conditions under which patches become   synchronized. We show that the patches in non-seasonal deterministic   models often oscillate in phase for all but the weakest between patch   coupling. Synchronization is also seen for stochastic models, although   slightly stronger coupling is needed to overcome the random effects. We   demonstrate that the inclusion of seasonal forcing in deterministic   models can lead to the maintenance of phase differences between patches.   Complex dynamic behaviour is observed in the seasonally forced spatial   model, along with the coexistence of many different behaviours. Compared   to the non-spatial model, chaotic solutions are observed for weaker   seasonal forcing; these solutions have a more realistic minimum number   of infectives.

	abstract = {Alternative explanations for disease and other population cycles typically include extrinsic environmental drivers, such as climate variability, and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics resulting from feedbacks within the system, such as species interactions and density dependence. Because these different factors can interact in nonlinear systems and can give rise to oscillations whose frequencies differ from those of extrinsic drivers, it is difficult to identify their respective contributions from temporal population patterns. In the case of disease, immunity is an important intrinsic factor. However, for many diseases, such as cholera, for which immunity is temporary, the duration and decay pattern of immunity is not well known. We present a nonlinear time series model with two related objectives: the reconstruction of immunity patterns from data on cases and population sizes and the identification of the respective roles of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in the dynamics. Extrinsic factors here include both seasonality and long-term changes or interannual variability in forcing. Results with simulated data show that this semiparametric method successfully recovers the decay of immunity and identifies the origin of interannual variability. An application to historical cholera data indicates that temporary immunity can be long-lasting and decays in approximately 9 yr. Extrinsic forcing of transmissibility is identified to have a strong seasonal component along with a long-term decrease. Furthermore, noise appears to sustain the multiple frequencies in the long-term dynamics. Similar semiparametric models should apply to population data other than for disease.},

These different forms of ideotypes in turn lead to different strategies for breeding plants. This paper will briefly describe, analyse and discuss some applications of these ideotype views, using the specific case of architectural traits of plant and crop canopies to limit the epidemic development of pests and diseases in crops.

Isolates of the four forms were   identified as C. gloeosporioides, based on morphology. The reaction of   monoconidial cultures on casein hydrolysis medium (CHM), PCR-RFLP and   sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of the   ribosomal DNA (ITS1-5-8S-ITS2) were used to establish the identity of   the yam anthracnose pathogen(s). All yam isolates were distinguished   from C. acutatum by the absence of protease activity on CHM. On ITS PCR   and enzymatic digestion of PCR products, all FGS, FGO and SGG isolates   produced RFLP patterns identical to those of C. gloeosporioides   reference isolates, while FGG isolates revealed unique ITS RFLP banding   patterns. Sequence analysis of the ITS1 region and of the entire ITS   region revealed that SGG, FGS and FGO isolates were highly similar   (98-99\% nucleotide identity) and showed 97-100\% identity to C.   gloeosporioides. Less than 93\% similarity of these fungal isolates to   reference C. acutatum and C. lindemuthianum isolates was observed. The   molecular study confirmed that foliar anthracnose of yam is caused by C.   gloeosporioides. While a high similarity was found among most C.   gloeosporioides fungi from yam, isolates of the FGG form did not cluster   with any previously described Colletotrichum species, and probably   represent a distinct species.},

	doi = {10.1186/1741-7007-6-9},
	abstract = {Background: In order to initiate plant infection, fungal spores must   germinate and penetrate into the host plant. Many fungal species   differentiate specialized infection structures called appressoria on the   host surface, which are essential for successful pathogenic development.   In the model plant pathogen Magnaporthe grisea completion of mitosis and   autophagy cell death of the spore are necessary for appressoria-mediated   plant infection; blocking of mitosis prevents appressoria formation, and   prevention of autophagy cell death results in non-functional   appressoria.   Results: We found that in the closely related plant pathogen   Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, blocking of the cell cycle did not   prevent spore germination and appressoria formation. The cell cycle   always lagged behind the morphogenetic changes that follow spore   germination, including germ tube and appressorium formation,   differentiation of the penetrating hypha, and in planta formation of   primary hyphae. Nuclear division was arrested following appressorium   formation and was resumed in mature appressoria after plant penetration.   Unlike in M. grisea, blocking of mitosis had only a marginal effect on   appressoria formation; development in hydroxyurea-treated spores   continued only for a limited number of cell divisions, but normal   numbers of fully developed mature appressoria were formed under   conditions that support appressoria formation. Similar results were also   observed in other Colletotrichum species. Spores, germ tubes, and   appressoria retained intact nuclei and remained viable for several days   post plant infection.   Conclusion: We showed that in C. gloeosporioides the differentiation of   infection structures including appressoria precedes mitosis and can   occur without nuclear division. This phenomenon was also found to be   common in other Colletotrichum species. Spore cell death did not occur   during plant infection and the fungus primary infection structures   remained viable throughout the infection cycle. Our results show that   the control of basic cellular processes such as those coupling cell   cycle and morphogenesis during fungal infection can be substantially   different between fungal species with similar lifestyles and pathogenic   strategies.},

The lesions observed on each of the top three leaves on plants within 1.5 m from the source lesion were three-dimensionally mapped. The total number of lesions within a 1.5 m radius was estimated by dividing the number of lesions observed within each 0.025 m-wide annulus by the fraction of the annulus sampled. The estimated total number of lesions produced within 1.5 m of a single source lesion ranged from 27 to 776, with a mean of 288 lesions. Eighty percent of the lesions were recorded within 0.69 m of the source infection. The proportion of total lesions observed at a given distance from the source was fitted well by the Lomax and Weibull distributions, reflecting the large proportion of lesions arising close to the source, and when fitted by an inverse power distribution had a slope (b) of 2.5. There were more lesions produced on leaves higher in the canopy than on lower leaves, with more lesions being detected above than below the point of inoculation. Simultaneous measurement of lesion gradients and spore dispersal in the final year of the study suggests that this pattern is due to greater susceptibility of upper leaves, rather than increased dispersal to upper leaves.},

	abstract = {Since weather has a major influence on the occurrence and development of crop diseases, valuable insight toward future agricultural planning emerges with assessment tools to evaluate fungal disease pressure and crop regional suitability under projected future climatic conditions. The aim of this study was to develop two climatic indicators, the average infection efficiency (AIE) and the number of infection days (NID), to quantify the potential effects of weather on the intensity and occurrence of pathogen infection. First, a simple and continuous infection function accounting for daily temperature and leaf wetness duration variations was implemented. The function was then parameterized from published data sets for five major contrasting fungal diseases affecting crops in Northern France: phoma of oilseed rape, late blight of potato, downy mildew of grape, leaf rust of wheat and net blotch of barley. Finally, AIE and NID were calculated for the recent past (1970–2000) and the future A1B climate scenario (2070–2100). An overall decrease in the risk of infection was shown for potato late blight and downy mildew of grapevine for all months during the period when the host plant is susceptible to infection. There were greater differences for the other three diseases, depending on the balance between warmer temperatures and lower humidity. The future climate would result in a later onset of disease and higher infection pressure in late autumn. In spring, for brown rust of wheat and net blotch of barley, the climatic risk for infection is expected to occur earlier but would result in lower infection pressure in May. These findings highlighted the need to use an infra-annual (monthly or seasonally) scale to achieve a relevant analysis of the impact of climate change on the infection risk. The described indicators can easily be adapted to other pathogens and may be useful for agricultural planning at the regional scale and in the medium term, when decision support tools are required to anticipate future trends and the associated risks of crop diseases.},

	abstract = {Splash seed dispersal by raindrops was investigated for plants in   southern Japan. Nine families, 10 genera and 19 species were confirmed   as raindrop-dispersed plants. The 10 genera were Gentiana , Gratiola ,   Chrysosplenium , Mazus , Mitella , Ophiorrhiza , Sagina , Sedum ,   Trigonotis and Veronica . The method of splash rain dispersal in these   species was clarified. Raindrop-dispersed species were all small   herbaceous plants with a vertical pedicel and an apically opening fresh   capsule when the seeds mature. Open capsules were cup-shaped or   boat-shaped and can accommodate raindrops easily. The raindrops splashed   the seeds from the capsule. In general, the seeds weighed very little,   but they were heavier than powder or dust seeds dispersed by wind. A   strong negative correlation was found between seed weight and the number   of seeds per capsule. In the case of Trigonotis brevipes (Maxim.)   Maxim., raindrops were received into the cup-shaped calyx-tube and   dispersed the fruitlets. Some species, such as Gentiana thunbergii (G.   Don) Griseb., Gentiana zollingeri Fawcett and Ophiorrhiza japonica   Blume, had hydroscopic movement capsules that opened widely only when   wet. Raindrop-dispersed plants were found in various habitats. For   example, some plants grew together on rocks along the mountain torrents   where splash water could easily be caught. The results of the laboratory   and field experiments indicated that the dispersal distance of seeds by   raindrops was 1 m or less. For small herbaceous plants, splash dispersal   by rain might be an effective and advantageous method of seed dispersal   because dispersal is not affected by plant height.},

	abstract = {Efficient, nonselective methods to obtain DNA from the environment are   needed for rapid and thorough analysis of introduced microorganisms in   environmental samples and for analysis of microbial community diversity   in soil. A small-scale procedure to rapidly extract and purify DNA from   soils was developed for in-the-field use, Amounts of DNA released from   bacterial vegetative cells, bacterial endospores, and fungal conidia   were compared by using hot-detergent treatment, freeze-thaw cycles, and   bead mill homogenization. Combining a hot-detergent treatment with bead   mill homogenization gave the highest DNA yields from all three microbial   cell types and provided DNA from the broadest range of microbial groups   in a natural soil community, Only the bead mill homogenization step was   effective for DNA extraction from Bacillus globigii (B, subtilis subsp,   niger) endospores or Fusarium moniliforme conidia. The   hot-detergent-bead mill procedure was simplified and miniaturized. By   using this procedure and small-scale, field-adapted purification and   quantification procedures, DNA was prepared from four different soils   seeded with Pseudomonas putida cells or B, globigii spores. In a New   Mexico soil, seeded bacterial targets were detected with the same   sensitivity as when assaying pure bacterial DNA (2 to 20 target gene   copies in a PCR mixture). The detection limit of P, putida cells and B,   globigii spores in different soils was affected by the amount of   background DNA in the soil samples, the physical condition of the DNA,   and the amount of DNA template used in the PCR.},

The spatial spread   of disease was simulated using a half-Cauchy distribution with median   dispersal distance mu (units of distance). A total of 54 different   quadrat types, including 23 distinct sizes ranging from 4 to 144 plants,   were used to sample the simulated epidemics. A symmetric form of the   binary power law with two parameters (alpha, beta) was fitted to the   sampled epidemic data using each of the 54 quadrats for each replicate   simulation run. The ct and beta estimates were highly correlated   positively with each other, and their estimates were comparable to those   estimated from observed epidemics. Intraclass correlation (kappa) was   calculated for each quadrat type; kappa decreased exponentially with   increasing quadrat size. An asymmetric form of the binary power law with   three parameters (alpha(1), beta(1), beta(2)) was used to relate kappa   to the disease incidence (p); beta(1) was highly correlated to beta:   beta(1) approximate to beta - 1. In general, initial conditions and   quadrat size affected alpha, beta, alpha(1), beta(1), and beta(2)   greatly. The parameter estimates increased as quadrat size increased,   and the relationships were described well by a linear regression model   on the logarithm of quadrat size with the slope or intercept parameters   dependent on initial conditions and mu. Compared with initial conditions   and quadrat size, the overall effects of mu and quadrat shape were   generally small, although within each quadrat size and initial condition   they could be substantial. Quadrat shape had the greatest effect when   the quadrat was long and thin. The relationship of the index of   dispersion (D) to p and quadrat size was determined from the alpha and   beta estimates. D was greatest when p was 0.5 and decreased when p   approached 0 or 1. It increased with quadrat size and the rate of the   increase was maximum when p was 0.5 and decreased when p approached 0 or   1.},

It is therefore important to determine   to what extent P.infestans populations can be selected for increased   aggressiveness by potato cultivars with different levels of partial   resistance. To this end, we sampled P infestans populations from France   and Morocco, chosen as locations where late blight occurs regularly but   which differ in the distribution of potato cultivars. Cross-inoculation   experiments were used to determine the aggressiveness of all populations   to potato cvs. Bintje (prevalent in France but not grown in Morocco) and   Desiree (popular in Morocco but cultivated to a very small extent in   France). French populations were more aggressive on cv. Bintje than on   cv. Desiree, irrespective of the site they were sampled from. Their   aggressiveness increased between early and late samplings, suggesting   that both cultivars selected for increased aggressiveness during   epidemics. By contrast, Moroccan populations were more aggressive on   Desiree, regarded as partially resistant in Europe, than on Bintje,   highly susceptible under European conditions. These data indicate that   P. infestans populations adapt to locally dominant cultivars,   irrespective of their resistance levels, and can therefore overcome   polygenic, partial resistance. This adaptive pattern may render partial   resistance nondurable if not properly managed.},

Clover significantly reduced the dispersal of   spores in a horizontal direction by 33\% at a distance of 15 cm from a   line inoculum source compared with a wheat monocrop. The clover also   reduced the vertical movement of spores from infected leaves at the base   of wheat plants by an average of 63 \% compared to the monocrop, and this   suggests that the main movement of spores was from the base upwards.   Splash experiments using blue colour marker showed the vertical decline   of splash and the number of drops per cm(2) with height caught on paper   adjacent to trays of clover was described by the exponential decline   model. The effect of clover in reducing vertical splash approached an   asymptote as the leaf area index of the understorey increased.

The   experiments were conducted during two consecutive spring and summer   seasons in 1999 and 2000 in replicated field experiments. The Gompertz   model described disease progress curves better than the logistic model.   Intercropping delayed epidemic onset, lowered disease incidence and   severity, and reduced the disease progress rate. The type of cropping   system and planting pattern affected CBB incidence and severity at   initial, final and overall assessments and also affected the rate of   disease development. Statistical significance of treatment interactions   based on disease assessments was found for incidence in all four   experiments and for severity in three experiments. A slower disease   progress rate and lower incidence and severity occurred on beans planted   with maize or sorghum in row, mixed and broadcast intercropping than on   bean planted alone. Incidence was reduced 36\% and severity 20\% in   intercropping compared to sole cropping. The built-in disease delay and   the slowing of the disease progress rate could provide protection for   beans from severe CBB epidemics in intercropped systems.

The trial   studied the effect of planting season on cassava anthracnose disease   (CAD) symptoms expression (disease severity index, canker size and first   canker distance from the ground). Another trial was carried out to   investigate genotype susceptibility over three consecutive planting   seasons using CAD incidence and severity. Disease severity index (DSI)   differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) among cassava   genotypes in both wet and dry season planting. CAD incidence and   severity also differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05)   among genotypes, with the wet season recording higher disease incidence   and canker size. CAD incidence and severity showed significant   correlation in the dry season (r = 0.91), but were negatively correlated   (r = -0.87) in the wet season. Necrotic lesion size and disease severity   in the dry season were not significantly correlated (r = 0.23).

We modified Charnov's classic diet composition model to describe the ecological dynamics of the related generalist and specialist bacteriophages phiX174 and G4, and confirmed that specialist phages are ecologically favored only at high host densities. Our modified model accurately predicted the ecological dynamics of phage populations in laboratory microcosms, but had only limited success predicting evolutionary dynamics. We monitored evolution of attachment rate, the phenotype that governs diet breadth, in phage populations adapting to both low and high host density microcosms. Although generalist phiX174 populations evolved even broader diets at low host density, they did not show a tendency to evolve the predicted specialist foraging strategy at high host density. Similarly, specialist G4 populations were unable to evolve the predicted generalist foraging strategy at low host density. These results demonstrate that optimal foraging models developed to explain the behaviorally determined diets of predators may have only limited success predicting the genetically determined diets of bacteriophage, and that optimal foraging probably plays a smaller role than genetic constraints in the evolution of host specialization in bacteriophages.},

	abstract = {We examined the effect of short-term exposure to high and low temperatures and a range of relative humidity (RH) on survival of Phytophthora ramorum hyphae. Spore-free hyphal colonies were grown on dialysis squares atop V8 medium. Colonies were transferred to water agar plates positioned at 27.5-50 C on a thermal gradient plate and incubated 2.5-480 min. For low temperature trials colonies were transferred to vials of distilled water and incubated in a water bath at -5 to -25 C for 1-24 h. In the relative humidity trials hyphal colonies were transferred to sealed humidity chambers containing various concentrations of glycerin for 1-8 h. Relative humidity was 41-93\% at 20 C and 43-86\% at 28 C. Survival in all trials was characterized by growth from dialysis squares into V8 medium. Temperatures of 37.5-40 C were lethal to P. ramorum hyphae within several hours, and temperatures of 42.5-50 C were lethal within minutes. Exposure to 32.5 and 35 C resulted in reduced survival over 8 h, while 30 C had no effect on three of four isolates. Hyphal colonies demonstrated considerable tolerance to cold, with all isolates surviving a 24 h exposure to -5 C. Survival diminished over time at lower temperatures, however a few colonies survived 24 h exposure to -25 C. Temperature also affected the ability of hyphal colonies to withstand reduced humidity. A RH of 41-43\% was lethal in 2 h at 28 C compared to 8 h at 20 C. Three of four isolates were unaffected by an 8 h exposure to 81 and 95\% RH at 20 C, and 73 and 86\% RH at 28 C. Isolate differences were apparent in tolerance to freezing temperatures and reduced humidity. From these results it is apparent that the cold temperatures found in the northeastern USA are not likely to prevent the establishment of P. ramorum. There is also the potential for hyphae, and presumably spores, to survive periods of high humidity on the leaf surface in the absence of free water.},

	abstract = {Coffee berry disease (CBD), caused by Colletotrichum kahawae, is a major   constraint for Arabica coffee cultivation in Africa. The disease is   specific to green berries and can lead to 60\% harvest losses. In   Cameroon, mixed cropping systems of coffee with other crops, such as   fruit trees, are very widespread agricultural practices. Fruit tree, are   commonly planted at random on coffee farms, providing a heterogeneous   shading pattern for coffee trees growing underneath. Based on a recent   study of CBD, it is known that those plants can reduce disease   incidence. To assess the specific effect of shade, in situ and in vitro   disease development was compared between coffee trees shaded   artificially by a net and trees located in full sunlight. In the field,   assessments confirmed a reduction in CBD on trees grown under shade   compared with those grown in full sunlight. Artificial inoculations in   the laboratory showed that shade did not have any effect on the   intrinsic susceptibility of coffee berries to CBD. Coffee shading mainly   acts on environmental parameters in limiting disease incidence. In   addition to reducing yield losses, agroforestry system may also be   helpful in reducing chemical control of the disease and in diversifying   coffee growers' incomes.},

	abstract = {Leaf wetness duration (LWD) is one of the most critical variables   involved in the development of plant diseases. Many pathogens require   the presence of free water on plant organs to move and to start their   infective processes. For this reason LWD is extremely significant in the   management of crop protection activities and in particular, the   successful use of weather-related disease forecasting models. Their   operational application is a very important tool for reducing fungicide   applications, for environmental safeguarding in high quality production   systems, and for reducing the waste of resources and financial losses.   Despite the relevance of LWD, no standard has yet been accepted for its   measurement. For this reason the use of simulation models, based on   agrometeorological variables, represents a valuable alternative to field   monitoring. In this work a physical model based on the energy balance   was applied for the simulation of LWD on a grapevine (Vitis vinifera).   The model, developed in the United States on the cultivars Chardonnay   and Concord, and in Australia on Cabernet Franc, was applied for the   Sangiovese variety and was adapted for use with agrometeorological data   easily available from standard weather stations. The model outputs were   compared both with data measured by sensors in the 1995-2003 period and   with visual inspections of LWD conducted on vines during 2003.   Following, simulated and recorded LWD data were used as input by a model   for the simulation of grapevine downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) and   the results were compared with observed data in order to establish the   impact of different LWD data on the quality of model simulations.

Spatial   pattern is one of the most characteristic ecological properties of a   species, and reflects environmental and genetic heterogeneity and   reproductive population growth acting on the processes of reproduction,   dispersal, and mortality. Species of Phytophthora can be dispersed   either in soil, via surface water movement down rows, from rain splash   dispersal, by air, or via movement by humans or invertebrate activity.   Dispersal results in patchiness in patterns of disease or inoculum in   soil. In this chapter we discuss the mechanisms of dispersal of members   of this important genus and describe several methods that can be used to   statistically analyze data for which spatial coordinates are known. The   methods include testing spatial autocorrelation for binary data or   continuous data, semivariograms, and regression models for spatial data.   The goal of spatial pattern analysis is to gain an understanding of the   mechanisms of dispersal of propagules and to sort out the physical and   biological factors that are important for spread of plant pathogens and   ultimately, for disease management.},

	issn = {1560-2745},
	abstract = {Colletotrichum is the causal agent of anthracnose and other diseases on leaves, stems and fruits of numerous plant species, including several important crops. Accurate species identification is critical to understand the epidemiology and to develop effective control of these diseases. Morphologically-based identification of Colletotrichum species has always been problematic, because there are few reliable characters and many of these characters are plastic, dependent upon methods and experimental conditions. Rapid progress in molecular phylogenetic methods is now making it possible to recognise stable and well-resolved clades within Colletotrichum. How these should be reflected in a classification system remains to be resolved. An important step in providing a stable taxonomy for the genus is to epitypify existing names, and in so doing link them to genetically defined clades. We recommend a polyphasic approach to the recognition and identification of species within Colletotrichum, matching genetic distinctness with informative morphological and biological characters. This paper reviews various approaches in the Study of Colletotrichum complexes including morphology, pathogenicity, physiology, phylogenetics and secondary metabolite production. A backbone phylogenetic tree using ITS sequence data from 42 ex-type specimens has been generated. Phylogenetic analysis using ITS sequence data is a useful tool to give a preliminarily identification for Colletotrichum species or place them in species complexes. However, caution must be taken here as the majority of the ITS sequences deposited in GenBank are wrongly named. Multi-gene phylogenetic data provides much better understanding of the relationships within Colletotrichum and Should be employed where possible. We propose that ail ideal approach for Colletotrichum systematics should be based on a multi-gene phylogeny, with comparison made with type specimens, and a well-defined phylogenetic lineage should be in conjunction with recognisable polyphasic characters, such as morphology, physiology, pathogenicity, cultural characteristics and secondary metabolites. Finally a set of protocols and methodologies is provided as a guideline for future Studies, epitypification and the description of new species.},

Sixty-three of the 127 isolates were clustered   into 13 distinct lineages usually correlating with geographic origin.   Where isolates from various regions were clustered together, most had   identical host genotype origin. The pathogen population sampled from   Carimagua, Colombia, a long-time Stylosanthes breeding and selection   site, with a savanna ecosystem, was highly diverse. A set of 12 S.   guianensis genotype differentials was used to characterize pathogenic   variability of 104 isolates and their virulence patterns were grouped   into 57 pathotypes. However, when they were tested on four Australian   differentials, they grouped into 11 pathotypes. As shown in previous   studies, no strict correlations existed between genetic diversity   measured by RAPD or RFLP, and pathotype defined by pathogenicity pattern   on the differentials. Southern blot analysis of the 127 isolates   revealed 23 hybridizing fragments, resulting in 41 fingerprint patterns   among the 127 isolates.

	abstract = {Yield and quality losses due to disease are major factors limiting crop   productivity; thus breeding for disease resistance is a primary goal for   many plant breeding programmes. Unfortunately, specific sources of   resistance are not always available. In cases where sources of genetic   resistance are limited or non-existent, manipulating plant architecture   to facilitate disease avoidance may be a valuable alternate approach to   mitigate disease severity. Modifications of plant architecture can be   used to reduce contact with the pathogen, create barriers to pathogen   growth and development, or create an unfavourable microclimate for   disease development. Architectural variants have long been observed by   plant breeders and geneticists, and are frequently utilized to develop   new plant types. Key variants that may facilitate disease control   include altered plant height, determinacy, branching patterns, branch or   leaf angle, flower position, organ coverage or shape, or root structure   patterns. Implementing disease avoidance by an architectural approach   requires an understanding of both the life cycle of the pathogen and the   genetic basis for the desired morphological traits. This review examines   examples where modified architecture can be employed to reduce disease.   Among the better-documented cases are modified canopy structure to   reduce white mould in dry bean and tightly closed ears to reduce    Fusarium ear rot of maize. These examples demonstrate that breeding for   modified plant architecture can be a valuable component of a broader   disease control strategy that also includes genetic resistance and   cultural and chemical controls.},

Fern anthracnose appeared in Florida in 1993,   has spread rapidly, and produces losses that approach 100\% in some   ferneries. To help develop recommendations for control and management of   fern anthracnose, the survival of the pathogen in soil and diseased   plant material and on clothing was investigated in laboratory and field   experiments. Survival of conidia, sclerotia, and conidia in infected   leaf debris was studied in soil maintained at five soil moisture levels.   Survival of conidia and sclerotia declined rapidly under moist   conditions (greater than or equal to 12\% moisture, vol/wt), but under   dry conditions, viable conidia could be detected up to 12 months after   incorporation into soil. Similar results were obtained in field   experiments in which infected leaf debris was buried in soil. Viable   conidia were recovered for up to 3 months in leaf debris stored under   laboratory conditions. Conidia applied to denim fabric were recovered up   to 5 weeks after application. This indicated that contaminated clothing   could transport conidia effectively within and between ferneries.   Inoculating ferns with dilutions of conidia demonstrated that at least   100 conidia per ml is required to infect and colonize leatherleaf fern   leaves. This threshold provides an estimate of levels of conidia   populations likely to result in disease and levels that sanitation or   cultural practices must exceed to be effective management methods.},

The equation asr =   R-max(T-max-T/T-max-T-opt)(T/T-opt)(Topt/Tmax-Topt), where r is the   daily rate of growth (or development) at any temperature, T-opt is the   optimum temperature, T-max is the maximum temperature, and R-max is the   maximum rate of growth or development at T-opt.

The adjusted   R-square of fit ranged from 0.747 to 0.998, mostly greater than 0.9. For   one maize dataset that contains independent data, the equation was shown   to be highly predictive.

	abstract = {Anthracnose, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is the   most serious disease affecting water yam (Dioscorea alata) in the   tropics. The objective of this study was to determine whether infected   yam residues from the previous growing season could be a source of   inoculum for the following yam crop. Residue decomposition and survival   of the fungus on residues and in the soil were studied in a 161-day   field experiment carried out during the dry season in Guadeloupe (French   West Indies), which corresponds to the post-harvest period of yam.   Artificially inoculated residues (leaves and stems) were put in   litterbags, which were then either placed on the soil surface or buried   at 0.1 m depth. Residue decomposition was also measured under laboratory   conditions to obtain the parameters required by a model of   decomposition. Residue decomposition in the field was greater in the   first month, then steadily decreased until the end of the experiment.   The decomposition rate decreased in the following order: buried leaves {\textgreater}   surface leaves {\textgreater} buried stems {\textgreater} surface stems. The model described   residue decomposition well, and the simulations showed that soil   moisture and residue quality were key factors controlling decomposition   in the field. Simulations also indicated that stems may stay more than   five months in soil due to the low decomposition rate of the   recalcitrant organic fraction. The number of C. gloeosporioides conidia   diminished sharply in the first month, and the rate of decrease was   similar to that of the labile fraction of residues as estimated by the   model. Over this period, the number of conidia was higher in residues   placed on the soil surface due to a larger amount of readily available   substrate. Later, survival of C. gloeosporioides was mainly limited by   the competition with microorganisms decomposing residues. Four months   after the beginning of the experiment, 30\% of the residues were still   present in the field, mainly as stems, and the number of conidia   represented less than 1\% of the initial amount (e.g. 10(3)-10(4) conidia   g(-1) dry matter). Pathogenicity of yam residues also sharply decreased   after the first month and was higher for residues on the soil surface.   By the end of the experiment, only stems on the soil surface exhibited   pathogenicity. C. gloeosporioides could not be detected either in the   soil in contact with the infected residues or in the control soil   without residues. Given that the period between harvest and planting is   approximately four months, our results indicated that stems on soil   surface may contribute to the primary infection of yam with anthracnose.

	abstract = {Disease spread occurs at several spatial scales, e. g., from field to   field, plant to plant, and leaf to leaf. So far, epidemiological models   have largely overlooked the multiscale nature of epidemics. Here, we   propose a model that simulates disease spread across multiple scales in   a nested hierarchy. The model is based on the central ideas of hierarchy   theory, i.e., (i) the system is decomposed vertically into levels and   horizontally into holons (elements at one level, which are complete   systems when seen from the lower level), and (ii) higher levels are   characterized by slower processes than lower levels. The model is   individual-based, the individuals being the holons, which are either   susceptible or infected. At each level, infections within one holon   (i.e., infections between holons of the level below) occur independently   from the other holons: infections between holons happen at the higher   level. The self-similarity of the model structure and processes across   all levels allows implementing the model with a simple recursive   algorithm. The behavior of the model was studied using methods commonly   applied to field data. Aggregation of the disease was characterized   through the incidence-incidence relationship and the binomial power law,   in order to study the effect of infectiousness at each level on disease   aggregation. Sensitivity analyses showed that disease incidences at all   levels were influenced by the infectiousness at any level, but   infectiousness at higher levels had more effect than infectiousness at   lower levels. It was also shown that increasing the probability of   infection at a given level increased aggregation at higher level(s) and   decreased aggregation at lower level(s). The results were consistent   between incidence-incidence relationship and power law analysis, but the   incidence-incidence relationship was more sensitive in detecting the   differences in aggregation between treatments.},

Dense foliage appears to support a microclimate   conducive to the colonization of peanut limbs by S. minor. Removal of   excess foliage before and during a Sclerotinia blight epidemic on the   susceptible genotype NC 7 has been shown to reduce the rate of disease   progress. Field tests in 1993 and 1994 examined control of Sclerotinia   blight among four peanut genotypes (NC 7, VA 93B, NC Ac 18016, and   Tamspan 90) with diverse canopy morphologies. Each cultivar had foliage   pruned with a rotary mower once (1993 and 1994) or twice (1994) during   the season. Applications of fluazinam (9.2 kg a.i./ha) were imposed on   the genotype x pruning treatments. Soil temperatures under the canopy of   each genotype and pruning treatment were measured and compared. Disease   data were collected weekly by counting the number of feet of plants   exhibiting lesions with visible fungus growth. Tamspan 90, a resistant   Spanish peanut, had the least Sclerotinia blight incidence. Pruning   measurably affected soil temperature for approximately 2 weeks following   pruning. Removal of foliage reduced disease and increased disease   control affected by fluazinam in fields with high disease pressure. In   some tests, yields were increased by pruning through a reduction in   disease pressure. Yields were lower when peanuts were pruned   excessively, especially late in the season. Pruning of excessive vine   growth can be an alternative, or complement, to fungicide treatments   when done in midseason during favorable weather when moderate to high   disease pressure occurs.},

The lowest risk pathogens are those with   strict asexual reproduction and low potential for gene flow. We will   present examples of high- and low-risk pathogens.

Methods The first model is a complex discrete mechanistic model   (M-model) that explicitly incorporates the dynamics of host growth and   the development and dispersion of the pathogen at the vine stock scale.   The second model is a simpler ordinary differential equations (ODEs)   compartmental SEIRT model (C-model) handling host growth (foliar   surface) and the ontogenic resistance of the leaves. With the M-model   various levels of vine development are simulated under three contrasting   climatic scenarios and the relationship between host and disease   variables are examined at key periods in the epidemic process. The   ability of the C-model to retrieve the main dynamics of the disease for   a range of vine growth given by the M-model is investigated.   Key Results The M-model strengthens experimental results observed   regarding the effect of the rate of leaf emergence and of the number of   leaves at flowering on the severity of the disease. However, it also   underlines strong variations of the dynamics of disease depending on the   vigour and indirectly on the climatic scenarios. The C-model could be   calibrated by using the M-model provided that different parameters   before and after shoot topping and for various vigour levels and   inoculation time are used. Biologically relevant estimations of the   parameters that could be used for its extension to the vineyard scale   are obtained.   Conclusions The M-model is able to generate a wide range of growth   scenarios with a strong impact on disease evolution. The C-model is a   promising tool to be used at a larger scale.},

The   technique was applied to evaluation of the development and severity of   anthracnose of mango fruit, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum   gloeosporioides. In this method, a stepper motor rotates the mango fruit   along its longitudinal axis while acquiring a sequence of 360 images of   its total surface (one image for each degree). This set of images is   used to create a pseudocylindrical 'equal-area' projection of the fruit   in a two-dimensional map containing complete morphometrical and   photometrical information of its surface.

Quantitative   data (percentage of area affected) can be used to establish an   assessment scale for the disease based on lesion spots measured, as well   as for detailed laboratory studies of mango anthracnose development. The   average error of the method is -0.1\%, standard deviation 0.44 (r(2) =   0.99), and it may be adapted for use with most commercial image   analysers and for other diseases with spot-like symptoms.},

This   anisotropy can appear in the mean number of spores deposited along a   given direction (anisotropy in density) and in the mean distance that a   spore travels in a given direction (anisotropy in distance). Specific   experiments together with a statistical methodology are proposed to   study this effect. The experiments are based on the use of a point   source of a traceable inoculum and susceptible trap plots in large   resistant field plots. The anisotropy is characterized by two functions:   a directional density function and a mean distance function which are   related with the anisotropics in density and distance, respectively. A   nonparametric approach is developed to estimate these functions and to   help in choosing a parametric model. Then, the parametric model is   estimated. In two field experiments, migrations up to 175 and 225 in   from the source were detected, with g 25\% of the trap plots infected.   Whatever the experiment, the two estimated anisotropies presented   different shapes (i.e., the number of spores dispersed in a given   direction was not proportional to the mean distance travelled by these   spores).},

	abstract = {Successful integrated pest management strategies depend on an accurate   evaluation of 'immigrant' inoculum coming into a managed area. Dispersal   of plant pathogenic fungus spores is comprised of a series of   inter-connected events. Starting with spore production, dispersal   depends, in turn, on spore release or removal from a substrate, spore   escape from the canopy space, transport and dilution of a spore cloud by   turbulent wind, loss of inoculum viability during transport, spore   removal from the atmosphere by precipitation, spore deposition on host   tissue, and the infection efficiency of deposited spores on susceptible   host tissue. All of these components change in time and space,   challenging the aerobiologist to identify critical biophysical processes   that control disease spread.   Some of these processes will be illustrated for two plant diseases:   apple scab caused by the pathogen Venturia inaequalis and tobacco blue   mold caused by the pathogen Peronospora tabacina. Both these pathogens   are dispersed by airborne spores. Ascospores of the apple scab pathogen   become airborne primarily during rain events, while P. tabacina   sporangia become airborne primarily during dry, convective conditions.   Initial success of dispersal depends on, wind gusts which allow escape   of spores from a crop canopy or the boundary layer of air just above the   ground. Microclimatic conditions at the time (e.g. day or night, rain or   no rain) and the location of spore release (upper or lower canopy) can   have a significant effect on subsequent dispersal of pathogens.   The rate of advance of a disease frontal boundary during long-distance   disease spread can be as much as six times faster than the local rate of   disease spread. This apparent anomaly will be discussed using tobacco   blue mold as an example. The rate of movement of the disease front in a   spatially heterogeneous distribution of hosts, is determined largely by   the relative rate of local disease development, the length scale of the   dispersal function, distance between regions of host plants, and the   area of those host regions. Factors such as ground transportation of   diseased transplants and changes in the pathogen's sensitivity to   fungicides can, at times, override the biophysical constraints on   long-distance spore dispersal.

	abstract = {In controlled environment studies, the influence of temperature and wetness duration on infection of strawberry leaves by Mycosphaerella fragariae was quantified by inoculating plants with a conidial suspension and incubating them at various combinations of temperature (5 to 35 degrees C) and leaf wetness duration (0 to 96 h). Infection was expressed as the number of lesions per square centimeter of leaf surface and relative infection was used to develop an infection model. Younger leaves were more susceptible to infection. Regardless of temperature and duration of leaf wetness, only few lesions developed on the oldest (19 to 21 days old) and intermediate leaves (12 to 15 days old), respectively (maximum of 1.7 and 2.3 lesions per cm(2)) as compared to the youngest leaves (5 to 7 days old; maximum of 12.6 lesions per cm(2)). On the youngest leaves, lesions developed at all temperatures except at 35 degrees C, and the number of lesions, for all leaf wetness durations, increased gradually from 5 to 25 degrees C and decreased sharply from 25 to 30 degrees C. For temperatures of 15 and 20 degrees C, the number of lesions increased gradually when leaf wetness duration increased from 12 to 96 h. At 25 degrees C, the number of lesions increased with increasing leaf wetness from 12 to 48 h and then at a higher rate from 48 to 96 h. The optimal temperature for infection was 25 degrees C. For most temperatures, a minimum of 12 h of leaf wetness was necessary for infection (more than 1 lesion per cm(2)). Relative infection was modeled as a function of both temperature and wetness duration using a modified version of the Weibull equation (R (2) = 0.98). The resulting equations provided a precise description of the response of M. fragariae to temperature. The model was sufficiently flexible to account for most characteristics of the response of M. fragariae to wetness duration. The model was used to construct a risk chart that can be used to estimate the potential risk for infection based on observed or forecasted temperature and leaf wetness duration.},

The model represents primary and   secondary infection rates and a time-varying host susceptibility with   applications to a wide range of epidemiological systems. A Markov chain   Monte Carlo algorithm is presented that allows the model to be fitted to   experimental observations within a Bayesian framework. The approach   allows the uncertainty in unobserved aspects of the process to be   represented in the parameter posterior densities. The methods are   applied to experimental observations of damping-off of radish (Raphanus   sativus) caused by the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, in the   presence and absence of the antagonistic fungus Trichoderma viride, a   biological control agent that has previously been shown to affect the   rate of primary infection by using a maximum-likelihood estimate for a   simpler model with no allowance for a latent period. Using the Bayesian   analysis, we are able to estimate the latent period from population   data, even when there is uncertainty in discriminating infectious from   latently infected individuals in data collection. We also show that the   inference that T viride can control primary, but not secondary,   infection is robust to inclusion of the latent period in the model,   although the absolute values of the parameters change. Some refinements   and potential difficulties with the Bayesian approach in this context,   when prior information on parameters is lacking, are discussed along   with broader applications of the methods to a wide range of   epidemiological systems.},

	abstract = {A study was conducted (i) to obtain a clear and precise picture of Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) genetic diversity and (ii) to assess the effect of between host transmission and intra-host multiplication on the evolution of this virus. The results confirmed that the genetic diversity of PLRV was low and suggested that the virus was subject to very strong selective constraints. Thereafter, it was hypothesized that transmission by aphids and/or multiplication in the host plants were key factors structuring virus populations. Overall, the virus is poorly variable but also revealed that some isolates have undergone major evolutionary events such as recombination or deletions in a coding region. This suggests that, in natural conditions, the virus has reached an equilibrium although it seems able to rapidly adapt when subjected to environmental changes. Analyses of PLRV population structure in various conditions confirmed that vector transmission constitutes a strong constraint limiting the diversity of the population. They also showed that, by forcing the virus to explore a new cellular environment, the genome is allowed to vary more, confirming that the host plant cellular environment is also a key parameter constraining virus population diversity. In contrast, in the course of infection of different host plant species, diversity is hardly found, at least during the first months of infection, suggesting that PLRV is subject to strong   constraints within host plants, slowing down the process of adaptation to new hosts. Alternatively, it is possible that PLRV genome has a poor intrinsic variability. All these results are used to propose some   hypotheses on PLRV evolution.},

	abstract = {Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz., is the most   severe foliar disease of water yam (Dioscorea alata) worldwide.   Population genetic analyses can yield useful insights into the   evolutionary potential of C. gloeosporioides and thus lead to the   development of appropriate disease management strategies. The genetic   structure of C. gloeosporioides populations from yam and non-yam hosts   in three agroecological zones of Nigeria was investigated.   Microsatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction (MP-PCR), virulence   phenotyping using five putative D. alata differentials,   cross-inoculation tests, and the presence/absence of a Glomerella   teleomorph in yam fields were used to infer the evolutionary potential   of C. gloeosporioides on yam. We observed high genotypic diversity (GD =   0.99 to 1.00) for populations from all hosts and agroecological zones,   with multiple pathogen genotypes in individual anthracnose lesions.   Genetic differentiation was low among pathogen populations from   different hosts (G(ST) = 0.10, theta = 0.034), and agroecological zones   (G(ST) = 0.04, theta = 0.018), indicating limited host differentiation   and significant gene flow. No evidence was found for the existence of C.   gloeosporioides f. sp. alatae reported in previous studies. The fungus   was recovered from several non-yam host species commonly found in yam   fields but non-yam isolates caused only mild to moderate symptoms on   yam. Eighteen C. gloeosporioides virulence phenotypes were identified   among 217 isolates but there was a weak correlation (r = 0.02, P = 0.40)   between virulence phenotype and MP-PCR haplotype. Consistent with the   above findings, we observed for the first time the Glomerella teleomorph   on anthracnose-infected yam plants in Nigeria, indicating that sexual   recombination might play an important role in anthracnose epidemics on   yam. The implications of these findings for C. gloeosporioides   evolutionary potential and anthracnose resistance breeding are   discussed.},

	abstract = {The study of parasite virulence has generally focused on the conditions   under which virulence is expected to increase or decrease over time and   how the interactions between hosts and their environments may mediate   the outcome of infection. Recently, parasite traits such as   transmission, offspring production, and development have also been shown   to be influenced by environmental variation. What is unclear is how   variation in the parasite's environment may impact virulence. Recent   theory demonstrates that plasticity can promote the evolution of   decreased virulence; thus, understanding whether the parasite's   environment can mediate virulence can improve predictions regarding the   outcome of parasite infection. Here, an obligate mosquito parasite was   reared in hosts fed high or low levels of food. Parasite oocysts   (offspring) produced in these two host environments were subsequently   fed to uninfected hosts. Parasites originating from well-fed hosts were   found to be more virulent to these subsequent hosts compared to   parasites originating from poorly fed hosts. Additionally, this effect   was apparent only when current hosts were food deprived. These results   demonstrate that parasite virulence was mediated by a cross-generational   effect of the environment and that the overall outcome of infection was   modified by variation in both the parasite's and host's environments.},

Experiments on both pathogens were done in still air; additional   experiments were done on brown rust with simulated wind and rain. Spore   dispersal was estimated by trapping spores on wheat plants and assessing   the disease symptoms which subsequently developed under optimum   conditions. Simulated rainfall of each the four drop sizes tested   dispersed spores of both pathogens. In still air spore dispersal   patterns were similar to those usuary found for pathogens which are   characteristically splash-dispersed. Rain exhausted the source of spores   in about 20 min for the four drop sizes. When the plants were kept under   optimal conditions for sporulation, the source of brown rust spores   available for dispersal was restored to its initial numbers in about 2 h   after depletion. For yellow rust, spore numbers in the source had not   been restored to their original value after 6 h, even under optimal   conditions. In the wind tunnel experiments, simulated rain did not   inhibit the dispersal of brown rust spores by wind. Large incident drops   dispersed more spores of both pathogens than small drops. A simulation   study based on the experimental relationships obtained was done.   Although these experiments clearly show that rainfall has the potential   to spread both brown rust and yellow rust of wheat, the understanding of   the exact role of rain dispersal in the epidemiology of both diseases   requires further investigation.

Regression analysis of the field population showed that aggressiveness increased towards a resistant cultivar, but not towards a susceptible cultivar, that is no longer grown commercially. 

Here we report for the first time that aggressiveness increased on both cultivars after a few initial infection cycles at twice-ambient CO2 as isolates adapted to combat enhanced host resistance, while at ambient CO2 this increased steadily for most cycles as both cultivars selected for increased aggressiveness. Genetic fingerprint and karyotype of isolates changed for some CO2-cultivar combinations, but these were not related to changed aggressiveness. 

At 700 ppm fecundity increased for both isolates, and this increased population size, in combination with a conducive microclimate for anthracnose from an enlarged plant canopy under elevated CO2, could accelerate pathogen evolution.},

	abstract = {Background Mathematical models have become invaluable management tools   for epidemiologists, both shedding light on the mechanisms underlying   observed dynamics as well as making quantitative predictions on the   effectiveness of different control measures. Here, we explain how   substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored,   assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models.   Methods and Findings First, we use analytical methods to show that (i)   ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of   exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including   the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic   reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed   to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an   influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori   assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically   overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management   options.   Conclusion This work aims to highlight that, when developing models for   public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic   assumptions embedded within classical frameworks.},

	abstract = {Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum sp., is a serious problem of   lupins (Lupinus spp.) worldwide. Morphological characters and molecular   markers were used to characterize 43 Colletotrichum isolates from   lupins, 8 isolates from other hosts, and 18 reference isolates   representing related Colletotrichum spp., to assess the pathogen   diversity and resolve its taxonomy. All lupin Colletotrichum isolates   tested positive with C acutatum-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)   and did not test positive with C gloeosporioides-specific PCR. Spore   shape and colony diameter as well as insensitivity to benomyl grouped   the lupin anthracnose isolates closer to C acutatum than to C   gloeosporioides. Analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences   of 57 Colletotrichum isolates grouped all lupin isolates with C acutatum   and distinct from C gloeosporioides. Further, tub2 and his4 sequences   revealed groups concordant with ITS, reducing the excessive dependence   on the latter. Arbitrarily primed-PCR and amplified fragment length   polymorphism analyses revealed intraspecific subgroups, but neither was   useful to decipher species level relationships. ITS, tub2, and his4   results strongly support designating lupin anthracnose pathogen as C.   acutatum or its subspecies. Most Colletotrichum isolates from lupins   from worldwide locations are genetically homogeneous and form a distinct   subgroup within C. acutatum. Present results also underline the   potential of the C acutatum-specific PCR for routine pathogen diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Take-all dynamics within crops differing in cropping history (the number   of previous consecutive wheat crops) were analyzed using an   epidemiological model to determine the processes affected during   take-all decline. The model includes terms for primary infection,   secondary infection, inoculum decay, and root growth. The average rates   of root production did not vary with cropping history. The force of   primary infection increased from a low level in 1st wheat crops, to a   maximum in 2nd to 4th wheat crops, and then to intermediate levels   thereafter. The force of secondary infection was low but increased   steadily during the season in first wheat crops, was delayed but rose   and fell sharply in 2nd to 4th wheat crops, and for 5th and 7th wheat   crops returned to similar dynamics as that for 1st wheat crops. Chemical   seed treatment with silthiofam had no consistent effect on the take-all   decline process. We conjecture that these results are consistent with   (i) low levels of particulate inoculum prior to the first wheat crop   leading to low levels of primary infection, low levels of secondary   infection, and little disease suppression; (ii) net amplification of   inoculum during the first wheat crop and intercrop period; (iii)   increased levels of primary and secondary infection in subsequent crops,   but higher levels of disease suppression; and (iv) an equilibrium   between the pathogen and antagonist populations by the 5th wheat,   reflected by lower overall rates of primary infection, secondary   infection, disease suppression and hence, disease severity.},

This method was applied to the   Leptosphaeria maculans-Brassica napus pathosystem. The potential   durability of two new major resistance genes introgressed into B. napus   from the Brassica B genome was tested separately for each gene under   field conditions for 4 years. Successive inoculations with residues of   the resistant lines mixed with susceptible contaminated plant material   recovered at harvest the previous year were performed in autumn. The   Jlm1 resistance gene originating from B. juncea conferred complete   resistance on the B. napus-B. juncea recombinant lines MX and MXS to   inoculation of the cotyledons with a large diversity of L. maculans   isolates. It also gave a high lever of stem canker resistance in the   field against natural populations of the pathogen. A similar level of   resistance was obtained in the B. napus-B. nigra addition line LA4+,   containing B. nigra chromosome 4 in a B. napus background. In the second   year of the field experiment (i.e., the first in which residues from the   resistant lines were included in the inoculation material), both MX and   LA4+ maintained a high level of resistance. In the third and fourth   years of the field experiment, the resistance of MX and MXS exposed to   inoculum produced from their own residues broke down, but against fungal   populations from susceptible B. napus or resistant B. nigra material   remained effective. In contrast, LA4+ remained highly resistant to all   sources of inoculum for the 4-year experiment.},

	abstract = {The spread and infection by  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides [ Glomerella   cingulata] conidia of  Stylosanthes scabra cv. Fitzroy were determined   from single drop impaction, simulated rain and field experiments. Single   drops, 3.4 and 4.9 mm in diameter, were released from heights of 25 and   100 cm above a diseased leaflet, and conidia were collected on   microscope slides at different distances from the leaflet. Simulated   raindrops, 3.4 and 4.9 mm in diameter, were made to fall for 15 and 30   minutes onto a line source of diseased seedlings and conidia were   collected on microscope slides and Fitzroy seedlings at different   distances from the source. Fall height and raindrop diameter   significantly affected dispersal in single drop impaction and simulated   rain, respectively. Half-distance ( d50  ), the distance at which the   number of conidia decreases by half, was 1.6 to 2.6 cm under single drop   impaction, and between 6.3 and 11.5 cm under simulated rain conditions.   Predictions were compared to actual distances travelled by conidia, as   determined by exposing microscope slides and seedlings at different   distances from a clumped point source of diseased seedlings on different   dates during 1998 and 1999. A maximum  d50   of 4.1 cm and 15.8 cm,   respectively, were predicted using equations from the single drop and   simulated rain studies. This contrasted with actual half-distances of   between 1.1 and 9.6 m for conidial dispersal in the field. While a   negative exponential model better explained conidia dispersal gradients   under single drop impaction and simulated rain than an inverse power law   model, the reverse was true for dispersal in the field. Lesions were   detected up to 10 cm away from inoculum source under simulated rain, but   up to 5 m under field conditions. Between 74 and 90\% of the variability   associated with conidia dispersal in the field was due to weather, of   which hours of relative humidity over 95\% and rain intensity were the   most significant variables. On occasions, conidia were spread up to 10 m   in the field without rain. This suggests mechanisms in addition to   splash dispersal are responsible, however, the small range of wind speed   and gust encountered during the study did not significantly influence   dispersal.},

Because two previous experiments   with a small number of bread wheat cultivars and isolates of   Mycosphaerella graminicola had indicated that more susceptible hosts   selected for more aggressive isolates, we conducted a larger experiment   to test that hypothesis. In each of 2 years, six cultivars differing in   their levels of partial resistance were planted in field plots, and   isolates were collected from each cultivar early and late in the growing   season. The isolates were inoculated as populations bulked by cultivar   of origin, field replicate, and collection date on seedlings of the same   six cultivars in the greenhouse. The selective impact of a cultivar on   aggressiveness was measured as the difference in aggressiveness between   early and late isolates from that cultivar. Regression of those   differences on disease severity in the field yielded significance values   of 0.0531 and 0.0037 for the 2 years, with moderately resistant   cultivars selecting for more aggressive isolates. In a related   experiment, the protectant fungicide chlorothalonil was applied to plots   of two susceptible cultivars to retard epidemic development. When tested   in the greenhouse, isolates of M. graminicola from those plots were   significantly more aggressive than isolates from the same cultivars   unprotected by fungicide.},

Germination of sporangia was assessed   at the end of each wetness period and infection was evaluated from   assessments of disease severity 5 days after inoculation. Three response   surface models based on modified forms of the Weibull function were   evaluated for their ability to describe germination of sporangia and   infection in response to temperature and leaf wetness duration. The   models estimated 15.7 to 17.3 and 19.5 to 21.7 degrees C as the optimum   temperature (t) range for germination and infection, respectively, with   little germination or infection at 5 or 30 degrees C. For wetness   periods of 4 to 8 h, a distinct optimum for infection was observed at t   = 20 degrees C but broader optimum curves resulted from wetness periods   {\textgreater}8 h. Model 1 of the form f(w,t) =f(t) x (1 - exp\{-[B x W]D\}) resulted   in smaller asymptotic standard errors and yielded higher correlations   between observed and predicted germination and infection data than   either model 2 of the form f(w,t).

In the validation of the models using data generated   with a different isolate of P cubensis, slopes of the regression line   between observed and predicted germination and infection data were not   significantly different (P {\textgreater} 0.2487) and correlation coefficients   between observed and predicted values were high (r(2) {\textgreater} 0.81).

	abstract = {It is usually recognized that relatively large amounts of soil particles   cannot be transported by raindrop splashes under windless rain. However,   the splash-saltation process can cause net transportation in the   prevailing wind direction since variations in splash-saltation   trajectory due to the wind are expected in wind-driven rain. Therefore,   determining the combined effect of rain and wind on the process should   enable improvement of the estimation of erosion for any given prediction   technique. This paper presents experimental data on the effects of slope   aspect, slope gradient, and horizontal wind velocity on the   splash-saltation trajectories of soil particles under wind-driven rain.   In a wind tunnel facility equipped with a rainfall simulator, the rains   driven by horizontal wind velocities of 6, 10, and 14 m s(-1) were   allowed to impact three agricultural soils packed into 20 x 55 cm soil   pans placed at both windward and leeward slopes of 7\%, 15\%, and 20\%.   Splash-saltation trajectories were measured by trapping the splashed   particles at distances downwind on a 7-m uniform slope segment in the   upslope and downslope directions, respectively, for windward and leeward   slopes. Exponential decay curves were fitted for the mass distribution   of splash-saltation sediment as a function of travel distance, and the   average splash-saltation trajectory was derived from the average value   of the fitted functions. The results demonstrated that the average   trajectory of a raindrop-induced and wind-driven soil particle was   substantially affected by the wind shear velocity, and it had the   greatest correlation (r = 0.96 for all data) with the shear velocity;   however, neither slope aspect nor slope gradient significantly predicted   the splash-saltation trajectory. More significantly, a statistical   analysis conducted with nonlinear regression model of C-1(u(*)(2)/g)   showed that average trajectory of splash saltation was approximately   three times greater than that of typical saltating sand grain.

	issn = {0265-0746},
	abstract = {A mechanistic random 'jump' model is developed to describe the   stochastic processes of splash dispersal of plant pathogens from a point   source. In this model the main physical processes involved in the   spatial spread of these spores are incorporated. That is, the   probability per time unit that a spore is splashed lambda, the   probability that it then travels over some distance D(x), and the   probability that it is not removed during this dispersal process   epsilon. Numerical analysis shows the importance of ground cover and   rain intensity on the model output. Factors influencing the process can   be captured by changing the parameter values. For high rain intensities   lambda is large, therefore more spores are splashed; and, since epsilon   is expressed per splash, simultaneously more spores will be removed from   the system. The effect of ground cover is captured by epsilon; its value   decreases if the probability of staying in the process decreases. In   addition, an equation is derived for the mean squared distance that   spores splash. This equation shows a linear function independent of   D(x). Finally, a diffusion approximation is developed for the   mechanistic model and is compared to a diffusion model for splash   dispersal developed by Yang el al. (1991a), New Phtol. 118, 295-301. The   diffusion equation can only be considered a reasonable approximation to   the full model under certain limiting conditions.},

Genomic regions involved in resistance (QTLs) have been   previously identified in the pea genome, but the molecular basis of the   resistance is still unknown. The objective of this study was to map   resistance gene analogs (RGA) and defense-related (DR) genes in the   JI296 x DP RIL population that has been used for mapping QTLs for   resistance to M. pinodes, and identify co-localizations between   candidate genes and QTLs. Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers   designed on the conserved motifs P-loop and GLPL of cloned resistance   genes, we isolated and cloned 16 NBS-LRR sequences, corresponding to   five distinct classes of RGAs. Specific second-generation primers were   designed for each class. RGAs from two classes were located on the   linkage group (LG) VII. Another set of PCR-based markers was designed   for four RGA sequences previously isolated in pea and 12 previously   cloned DR gene sequences available in databases. Out of the 16 sequences   studied, the two RGAs RGA-G3A and RGA2.97 were located on LG VII,   PsPRP4A was located on LG II, Peachi21, PsMnSOD, DRR230-b and PsDof1   were mapped on LG III and pea beta glu and DRR49a were located on LG VI.   Two co-localizations between candidate genes and QTLs for resistance to   M. pinodes were observed on LG III, between the putative transcription   factor PsDof1 and the QTL mpIII-1 and between the pea defensin DRR230-b   gene and the QTL mpIII-4. Another co-localization was observed on LG VII   between a cluster of RGAs and the QTL mpVII-1. The three   co-localizations appear to be located in chromosomal regions containing   other disease resistance or DR genes, suggesting an important role of   these genomic regions in defense responses against pathogens in pea.},

However this approximation leads to significant errors in the evaporative term and by consequence in the LWD computation. In this work, consequences of the use of the Penman–Monteith equations instead of the exact solution were firstly investigated on single droplets and compared to experimental values obtained in controlled and constant conditions. For these studies, the LWD is overestimated by 12\% when Penman–Monteith equations were used. The ability of LWD estimate from the linearized energy balance equation to forecast risk infection of a leaf by V. inaequalis conidia was investigated.

For whole plants exposed to varying   dew periods at 20 degrees C and then incubated at 20 degrees C for 7   days, a dew period as short as 1 h resulted in a small amount of   disease; however, at least 4 h of dew were required for {\textgreater} 10\% of the   leaves to become diseased. Moisture periods of 24 and 48 h resulted in   the greatest number of diseased leaves. In detached-leaf,   temperature-gradient-plate experiments, incubation at 22 degrees C   resulted in the greatest disease severity, followed by 18 degrees C and   then 14 degrees C. In detached-leaf, moisture-tent experiments, a 1-h   moisture period was sufficient to cause disease on 67 to 73\% of leaves   incubated for 7 days at 20 degrees C. A statistical model for disease   development that combined the effects of temperature and moisture period   was generated using nonlinear regression. Our results define temperature   and moisture conditions which allow infection by P. ramorum on   Cunningham's White rhododendron, and show that P. ramorum is able to   infect this host over a wide range of temperatures and moisture levels.

	abstract = {Two major goals of laboratory evolution experiments are to integrate from genotype to phenotype to fitness, and to understand the genetic basis of adaptation in natural populations. Here we demonstrate that both goals are possible by re-examining the outcome of a previous laboratory evolution experiment in which the bacteriophage G4 was adapted to high temperatures. We quantified the evolutionary changes in the thermal reaction norms--the curves that describe the effect of temperature on the growth rate of the phages--and decomposed the changes into modes of biological interest. Our analysis indicated that changes in optimal temperature accounted for almost half of the evolutionary changes in thermal reaction norm shape, and made the largest contribution toward adaptation at high temperatures. Genome sequencing allowed us to associate reaction norm shape changes with particular nucleotide mutations, and several of the identified mutations were found to be polymorphic in natural populations. Growth rate measures of natural phage that differed at a site that contributed substantially to adaptation in the lab indicated that this mutation also underlies thermal reaction norm shape variation in nature. In combination, our results suggest that laboratory evolution experiments may successfully predict the genetic bases of evolutionary responses to temperature in nature. The implications of this work for viral evolution arise from the fact that shifts in the thermal optimum are characterized by tradeoffs in performance between high and low temperatures. Optimum shifts, if characteristic of viral adaptation to novel temperatures, would ensure the success of vaccine development strategies that adapt viruses to low temperatures in an attempt to reduce virulence at higher (body) temperatures.},

Differential equation models are often used, but statistical inference for differential equations suffers from numerical challenges and poor agreement between observational data and deterministic models. Accounting for these departures via stochastic model terms requires full specification of the probabilistic dynamics, and computationally demanding estimation methods. Here, we demonstrate the utility of an alternative approach, generalized profiling, which provides robustness to violations of a deterministic model without needing to specify a complete probabilistic model. We introduce novel means for estimating the robustness parameters and for statistical inference in this framework. The methods are applied to a model for pre-vaccination measles incidence in Ontario, and we demonstrate the statistical validity of our inference through extensive simulation. The results confirm that school term versus summer drives seasonality of transmission, but we find no effects of short school breaks and the estimated basic reproductive ratio ℛ0 greatly exceeds previous estimates. The approach applies naturally to any system for which candidate differential equations are available, and avoids many challenges that have limited Monte Carlo inference for state–space models.},

However, there are few studies on key aspects of their biology. This is because, traditionally, many isolates of C. acutatum were identified as C. gloeosporioides. Using molecular biology techniques has enabled the distinction between them. The life cycle of C. acutatum comprises a sexual and other asexual stage, and there are still many ways to know genetic sexual phase and its relevance in the structure of the population. Colletotrichum acutatum has two types of infection strategies described in the genus Colletotrichum , intracellular hemibiotrófica and subcuticular-intramural necrotrophic, and can even set a latency period in order to cope with host defense mechanisms such as: the existence of preformed toxic compounds and phytoalexins, nutrient scarcity of the host's own tissue to meet to the energy requirements of the pathogen. Colletotrichum acutatum usually overwinters as mycelium and / or appressoria in different parts of the host. Conidia require the presence of water to be produced and their dispersion is produced by rain. Current management measures of this fungus include the use of the different resistance of cultivars, forms and crop management, chemical and biological control, and preventive strategies such as predictive models of disease. Thus, the aim of this paper is to present current knowledge on various aspects of the biology of C. acutatum and related species and includes a discussion on the progress to control this fungus.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new statistical computing method, called data cloning, to   calculate maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors for   complex ecological models. Although the method uses the Bayesian   framework and exploits the computational simplicity of the Markov chain   Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it provides valid frequentist inferences   such as the maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors. The   inferences are completely invariant to the choice of the prior   distributions and therefore avoid the inherent subjectivity of the   Bayesian approach. The data cloning method is easily implemented using   standard MCMC software. Data cloning is particularly useful for   analysing ecological situations in which hierarchical statistical   models, such as state-space models and mixed effects models, are   appropriate. We illustrate the method by fitting two nonlinear   population dynamics models to data in the presence of process and   observation noise.},

	doi = {10.1006/anbo.1999.0877},
	abstract = {A new sigmoid growth equation is presented for curve-fitting, analysis   and simulation of growth curves. Like the logistic growth equation, it   increases monotonically, with bath upper and lower asymptotes. Like the   Richards growth equation, it can have its maximum slope at any value   between its minimum and maximum. The new sigmoid equation is unique   because it always tends towards exponential growth at small sizes or low   densities, unlike the Richards equation, which only has this   characteristic in part of its range. The new sigmoid equation is   therefore uniquely suitable for circumstances in which growth at small   sizes or low densities is expected to be approximately exponential, and   the maximum slope of the growth curve can be at any value. Eleven widely   different sigmoid curves were constructed with an exponential form at   low values, using an independent algorithm. Sets of 100 variations of   sequences of 20 points along each curve were created by adding random   errors. In general, the new sigmoid equation fitted the sequences of   points as closely as the original curves that they were generated from.   The new sigmoid equation always gave closer fits and more accurate   estimates of the characteristics of the 11 original sigmoid curves than   the Richards equation. The Richards equation could not estimate the   maximum intrinsic rate of increase (relative growth rate) of several of   the curves. Both equations tended to estimate that points of inflexion   were closer to half the maximum size than was actually the case; the   Richards equation underestimated asymmetry by more than the new sigmoid   equation. When the two equations were compared by fitting to the example   dataset that was used in the original presentation of the Richards   growth equation, both equations gave good fits. The Richards equation is   sometimes suitable for growth processes that may or may not be close to   exponential during initial growth. The new sigmoid is more suitable when   initial growth is believed to be generally close to exponential, when   estimates of maximum relative growth rate are required, or for generic:   growth simulations.

	abstract = {Isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides obtained from yam-based   cropping systems in Nigeria, previously characterized on the basis of   morphology, virulence and rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)   sequence variation were further compared for vegetative compatibility   (VC). Chlorate-resistant nitrate non-utilizing (nit) mutants were   generated from the isolates and used in complementation (heterokaryon)   tests. Tests of VC between complementary mutants from different isolates   indicated the presence of several genotypes within a single field,   suggesting limited clonal spread. In some cases, isolates obtained from   the same lesion were observed to belong to different vegetative   compatibility groups (VCGs). No compatibility was observed between   isolates of the highly virulent slow-growing grey (SGG), the moderately   virulent fast-growing salmon (FGS) and the avirulent/weakly virulent   fast-growing grey (FGG) strains. Forty-one C. gloeosporioides isolates   belonged to 28 VCGs, giving a genotype diversity estimate of 0.68. This   diversity confirmed the high variability of the pathogen population as   revealed by previous characterization studies, however, a correlation   between VCGs and isolate groupings based on morphology and virulence was   not found. The finding that an isolate from weed was compatible with yam   isolates indicated that transfer of important traits, such as virulence,   may take place between isolates from yam and non-yam hosts. The VCG   diversity revealed by this study suggests that in addition to asexual   reproduction, sexual reproduction may play an important role in the   epidemiology of anthracnose on yam.},

	abstract = {An accurate assessment of the amount of pollen released in a cornfield   that reaches the female flowers (silks) is important for determining   both the amount and purity of seeds produced. A method for making this   assessment is presented. In this method, the movement of maize pollen in   and above a crop canopy is evaluated using a combination of measurements   and modeling. In particular, concentrations, C (grains m(-3)), and   downward vertical fluxes, F-V (grains m(-2) s(-1)) of pollen were   measured at several heights inside and above a flowering maize canopy,   and a Lagrangian stochastic (LS) simulation model was used to calculate   concentrations and fluxes of pollen at these locations. Model estimates   for the average release rate of pollen grains per area of crop, Q   (grains m(-2) s(-1)) were deduced by comparing measured and modeled   values of C. Using these determinations of Q, the model predicted well   (r(2) = 0.73) the measured pollen fluxes in the canopy. On average,   about 20\% of the pollen released by the tassels reached the height of   the silks in the canopy. Fluxes of pollen at silk height were highly   variable, however. This variability was mainly due to the faster wind   speeds and higher levels of turbulence in the upper canopy, which led to   greater amounts of rebound and re-entrainment of pollen grains from   leaves. The results of this study underscore the importance of rebound   and re-entrainment processes in the amount of maize pollen reaching the   silks. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We showed that   appressorium development in C. lindemuthianum can be divided into three   stages, and we obtained three nonpathogenic strains, including one   strain blocked at each developmental stage. H18 was blocked at the   appressorium differentiation stage; i.e., no genuine appressoria were   formed. H191 was blocked at the appressorium maturation stage; i.e.,   appressoria exhibited a pigmentation defect and developed only partial   internal turgor pressure. H290 was impaired in appressorium function;   i.e., appressoria failed to penetrate into bean tissues. Furthermore,   these strains could be further discriminated according to the bean   defense responses that they induced. Surprisingly, appressorium   maturation, but not appressorium function, was sufficient to induce most   plant defense responses tested (superoxide ion production and strong   induction of pathogenesis-related proteins). However, appressorium   function (i.e., entry into the first host cell) was necessary for   avirulence-mediated recognition of the fungus.},

	abstract = {Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and random amplified microsatellite (RAMS) analyses were used to determine the genetic relatedness within and between Ganoderma boninense isolates from infected oil palm and Ganoderma sp. from coconut stumps from different locations in Malaysia. RAPD analysis using four random primers (5’ACCTGGACAC3',
5’CAGCGACAAG3', 5’AGAGGGCACA3' and 5’TGACGGCGGT3') showed variations of banding patterns within and between the isolates from oil palm and coconut stumps, indicating that they were genetically heterogeneous. There was no specific banding pattern that could differentiate between G. boninense isolates from infected oil palm and Ganoderma sp. from
coconut stumps. RAMS analysis using four microsatellite primers, 5’BDB(ACA)5, 5’DD(CCA)5, 5’DHB(CGA)5 and 5’YHY(GT)5G, also showed variable banding patterns among the isolates from infected oil palm and coconut stumps. However, five common bands i.e. two bands (900 bp and 1200 bp) produced by primer (CGA)5, one band (1400 bp) by
primer (ACA)5 and two bands (350 bp and 380 bp) by primer (CCA)5 were shown by all the G. boninense isolates from infected
oil palm and Ganoderma sp. from coconut stumps. Dendrograms from cluster analysis based on UPGMA of RAPD and RAMS
data showed that G. boninense isolates from infected oil palm and Ganoderma sp. from coconut stumps did not cluster separately into two distinct clusters, but were clustered together, which indicated that both groups of Ganoderma are closely related. The finding that the Ganoderma isolates from coconut stumps are closely related to G. boninense isolates from infected oil palm would have an important bearing in the formulation of disease control measures and replanting procedures, especially in areas where the previous crop was coconut.},

The role of   pycnidiospores produced during asexual reproduction is poorly documented   and limits the understanding of the pathogen's population dynamics. The   objectives of this study were to assess rain-splash dispersal of   pycnidiospores of L. maculans from phoma leaf spots, and transmission of   the disease from oilseed rape stubble carrying pycnidia. The work was   conducted in still air with either a drop generator or a rain simulator.   The impact of simulated incident drops on phoma leaf spots resulted in   the dispersal of L. maculans pycnidiospores within splash droplets.   Ninety per cent of the spores were collected within 14 cm of the source   and a few were regularly observed up to 40 cm. Pycnidiospores produced   on oilseed rape stubble and dispersed by simulated rain infected oilseed   rape trap plants in a spatial pattern that matched the spatial dispersal   of the pycnidiospores. In the field, rain-splash dispersal of   pycnidiospores could increase the pathogen population and may enhance   sexual reproduction by facilitating the mating of initially spatially   separated isolates of opposite mating type.},
