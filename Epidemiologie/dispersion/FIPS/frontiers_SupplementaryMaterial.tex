\section{Supplementary Data}

Supplementary Material should be uploaded separately on submission. Please include any supplementary data, figures and/or tables. 

Supplementary material is not typeset so please ensure that all information is clearly presented, the appropriate caption is included in the file and not in the manuscript, and that the style conforms to the rest of the article. 

\section{Supplementary Tables and Figures}

For more information on Supplementary Material and for details on the different file types accepted, please see  \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial}{the Supplementary Material section}  of the Author Guidelines.

%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png
%%% If using panelled/compiled figures with subcaptions, use the subcaption package as in the second example.  N.B. This package is incompatible with the subfigure and subfig packages
%%%  NB logo1.jpg is required in the path in order to correctly compile front page header %%%
